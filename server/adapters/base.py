"""
server/adapters/base.py — Abstract base classes for game adapters.

GameRulesAdapter: Methods used by the state machine (FSM) for Soul Link logic.
GamePresentationAdapter: Methods used by the HTTP status page for display.
GameAdapter: Combined interface — most games implement both.

Each supported game (Gen 1 RBY, Gen 3 FRLG, Gen 4 HGSS/Pt, etc.) provides a
concrete adapter implementing these interfaces.

ISOLATION CONTRACT:
- Adapters MUST NOT import from server.server (circular dependency).
- Adapters load their own data files independently (from data/games/<gen>/).
- All game-specific display logic (sprites, items, areas, types) goes through
  adapter methods — never through standalone functions in server.py.
- Use gen4_hgsspt.py as the model adapter (zero external dependencies).
- Item/species data should be hardcoded or loaded from game data files,
  never imported from server.py.
