server/adapters/gen4_hgsspt.py — Game adapter for Gen 4 (HeartGold/SoulSilver/hg-engine).

One class serves two cartridges that do not share a memory layout (HeartGold/SoulSilver and the
hg-engine fork), so anything describing a CARTRIDGE (box geometry, the pairing foundation) is
keyed on the foundation rather than on the game_id they all share. Platinum is NOT served: it has
no routing row in server/adapters/__init__.py and its hello is refused by name, so this adapter
reads ONE data directory — the generated HeartGold/SoulSilver pack, data/games/gen4_hgss/. The
legacy Sinnoh tables (area_map_platinum.json, trainers_pt.json, encounters_pt.json and the
rp_*.json override chain) are gone.

Gen 4 uses National Pokédex IDs natively (1-493). Mon keys use the same
PID:OTID format as Gen 3. No CFRU/RR support.

# # 30*0x88 + 16 pad` (gen4_codec.py:175 for hgss, :183 for hge) — and both packs give the
# number outright (data/games/gen4_hgss/profile.json `mons_per_box`, same in
