"""Read Gen 1's rule-bearing tables straight out of a ROM, clean or randomized.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A Soul Link run may be played on ROMs randomized with Universal Pokemon
Randomizer ZX: both players use the same settings but DIFFERENT seeds, so their wild
encounter tables genuinely differ from each other and from the cartridge. Every table SLink
ships in ``data/games/gen1_rby/`` is derived from the pret decomps, which describe the
vanilla cartridge and nothing else. Showing that data beside a randomized ROM is not a
cosmetic problem: it tells a player a route holds Pidgey when it holds Abra.

So the ROM itself becomes the source of truth, and this module is the reader.

NO HARDCODED ROM OFFSETS. Every address comes from ``data/pret_rom_syms.json``, which is
generated from the decomps and carries the SHA-1 of the ROM each symbol set describes. A
symbol's value is ``bank << 16 | address`` -- NOT a flat file offset -- and the difference
is not subtle: ``BaseStats`` is ``0x0E43DE`` as a symbol and ``0x383DE`` in the file. Read it
the wrong way and every table scans plausible-looking garbage rather than failing.

WHAT MAKES A SCAN TRUSTWORTHY. On a CLEAN ROM the scan must reproduce the decomp-derived
tables exactly. That is a free known-positive control -- we have all three cartridges and
know what they contain -- and ``tests/unit/test_gen1_rom_scan.py`` enforces it. A scanner
that cannot reproduce the vanilla answer has no business reporting a randomized one.

VERIFIED LAYOUTS (all read from the real dumps, not inferred):

  Wild encounters   WildDataPointers, one 2-byte bank-local pointer per map id. The table's
                    LENGTH is not assumed: it ends where the first record it points at
                    begins, which self-terminates at 249 entries (R/B) and 250 (Yellow).
                    Each record is  db grass_rate, [10 x (level, species)],
                                    db water_rate, [10 x (level, species)]
                    where a block of ten is present ONLY when its rate is non-zero, so an
                    encounterless map is two zero bytes.

  Old Rod           An inline immediate, not a table: ItemUseOldRod holds `lb bc, 5, MAGIKARP`
                    which assembles to 01 85 05 -- opcode, species, level.

  Good Rod          GoodRodMons, two (level, species) pairs.

  Super Rod         R/B: SuperRodData, 3-byte (map, pointer) records terminated by 0xFF,
                    pointing at groups of `db count, [count x (level, species)]`.
                    YELLOW IS A DIFFERENT FORMAT and shares no code: SuperRodFishingSlots,
                    flat 9-byte records of `map, [4 x (species, level)]` -- note SPECIES
                    FIRST, the opposite order from every other table here.

  Base stats        28-byte records ordered by POKEDEX number, 150 of them. Mew is not in
                    the table on R/B; it sits alone at MewBaseStats. Yellow has no separate
                    Mew symbol. Record offset 19 is BASE_GROWTH_RATE, the curve byte
                    level_from_exp needs -- read from the record rather than inferred.
