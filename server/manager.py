# ── Game families ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The unit of link compatibility is the FAMILY, not the cartridge: Red, Blue and Yellow
# share an adapter and an area map, so any two of them can link; the same holds for
# FireRed/LeafGreen, Gold/Silver/Crystal, HeartGold/SoulSilver, Black/White. What
# separates families is a different map (Radical Red from vanilla FireRed, Emerald,
# Platinum from HGSS, B2W2 from BW) or a reshuffled world (the Archipelago builds).
# Every new run names its family up front, so the Manager knows which cartridge (and which
# companion) to hand out. Runs created before 2026-10-01 may still carry "" (detected).
