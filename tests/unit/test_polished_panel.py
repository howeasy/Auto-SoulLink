"""POL-PANEL Stage 2: the SLink panel behind the Phone card (docs/polished/PANEL.md).

Two layers, both against the REAL overlay artifacts:

* the ROM side is read out of patch/polished/src/panel.asm and the built overlay .sym, so the
  panel's wire (wSlinkPanelText, the two fixed-stride lines, the <RAM>/<LNBRK> script) is pinned to
  bytes that exist rather than to a description of them;
* the host side runs the same in-process rig as test_polished_client.py over a WRAM image laid out
  from that .sym and drives the shared AWAIT/STAGED handshake exactly as the cartridge does.

The rig detail that matters: gb_panel only stages on an **observed** CLOSED -> AWAIT transition, and
the Gen 2 binder only calls the panel present once it has seen the sampled frame counter MOVE. So a
real open is three frames, not two -- `_open()` does all three. Two frames silently shows the
fallback and never paints, which is the protocol working, not a bug.

Every test names its red control. Four of them are applied controls, not assertions of absence.
