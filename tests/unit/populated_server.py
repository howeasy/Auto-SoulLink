"""A server populated the way `tools/inject_full_mocks.py` populates one — in-process.

The route smoke test renders one linked pair and one memorial, which is enough to prove a
template compiles and not enough to prove it says anything. The mock injector is the
complete cast (six pairs, a pending capture, a dead zone, a boxed pair, a battle, PC boxes,
held items, badges), and it is what the payload fixtures under `tests/fixtures/ui/`
were captured from. Driving it through the REAL TCP handler — not `_dispatch`
directly — is what makes the adapter switch on hello, `connected_players` and the seq guard
all run, so the page under test is the page a live run shows.

The socket stays open until the fixture is torn down. The server marks a player disconnected
when its socket closes, and a dashboard rendered for two offline players is a different
page (see the injector's HOLD note).
