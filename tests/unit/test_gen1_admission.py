"""A run built from randomized ROMs must refuse to record events from the wrong cartridge.

Rule state built on the wrong ROM is worse than no run at all: the links, the dead zones and
the memorial all look real and all describe a game nobody played. So a run whose ROMs the
Manager built records each player's cartridge fingerprint, and a client is admitted to
connect and say hello and to NOTHING else until it proves it is running that cartridge.

The two halves that have to agree are computed in different places from different inputs --
the Manager fingerprints a ROM FILE, the server fingerprints what a CLIENT REPORTS -- so the
first test here is that they produce the same value for the same cartridge. Everything after
that is worthless if they do not.
