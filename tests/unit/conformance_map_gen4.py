"""The Gen 4 conformance map for docs/protocol.md §9 (card G3-A, "Gen 4 protocol conformance map").

The Gen 3 map (tests/unit/conformance_map.py) records, per §9 item, WHICH evidence lane proves it.
This file records the same thing for Gen 4 with one extra axis the Gen 3 map does not have: an
explicit NA column. Gen 4 is a second foundation (lua/gen4/client.lua + lua/gen4/entry.lua over
data/games/gen4_hgss/ and data/games/gen4_hge/), so several §9 items are Gen-3-only features the
Gen 4 client deliberately does not implement (Explode Mode, Rival Team Swap, the native
prompt/trade companion). Those are marked `evidence_layer="na"` with a REASON and carry no test.

Axes:

  evidence_layer
    "transport"  stream mechanics, proven by the SHARED connector/session lane
                 (tests/unit/test_connector_fragmentation.py, test_connector_reconnect.py);
                 Gen 4 uses the same lua/connector.lua + lua/core/session.lua as Gen 3, and the
                 gen4_world harness stubs net.send, so it cannot prove framing itself.
    "world"      payload/admission logic and the semantic reducer, proven by driving the
                 PRODUCTION lua/gen4/client.lua through tests/unit/gen4_world.py (a fake NDS +
                 fake BizHawk + fake server). Every line the client sends is strict-validated at
                 send time by gen4_world.World._make_net against tests/unit/protocol_schema.py.
    "live"       measured UI / on-screen text; only the real HUD/emulator settles these. The
                 gen4_world harness injects a RECORDING hud double (gen4_world.py:470-474), so
                 anything about the real HUD (e.g. text sanitisation) is not world-observable.
    "na"         NOT APPLICABLE to Gen 4 (a Gen-3-only feature or a server-side item). `na_reason`
                 is mandatory on every na row.

  test          the id of the proving test. For "world" items it is a test function registered in
                 tests/unit/test_gen4_protocol_conformance.py::_WORLD_TESTS (the meta-test
                 requires every world item to resolve to a real world test). `test=None` on a
                 world item is the "coverage owed" signal the meta-test raises. For "transport"
                 items it names the shared lane; for "live" items it may be None (not yet written).

  open          an optional named-OPEN note: a gap that is real and tracked, not a silent pass.
                 The hge routing suppression (tests/unit/gen4_world.py:458-459, which drops the
                 "not one the server routes" problem for heartgold_hge) is the load-bearing OPEN:
                 heartgold_hge has no _ROM_TYPE_TO_GAME_ID row yet (server/adapters/__init__.py:42-87;
                 G3a adds it), so an hge hello is currently NOT routable. That must be asserted
                 explicitly in the conformance suite, never inherited silently from the harness.

Every non-na item is a claim Gen 4 must satisfy; every na item is a claim Gen 4 does NOT make,
with the reason recorded so a future Gen 4 feature can flip the row to applicable.
