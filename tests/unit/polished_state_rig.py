"""Test helper (a plain module, not collected): the REAL server SoulLinkState driven by the events the composed
Polished client emits.

The Polished client tests (test_polished_box_contract.py, test_polished_withdraw_path.py ...) assert what the client
SENDS. What a command does to the SERVER (party_keys, party_size, queued_commands for BOTH players, sync_inflight,
rebuild_pending) was only ever argued from the code. PolishedStateBridge closes that gap: it walks the Rig's sent
events with a monotonic cursor (never re-feeding history), hands each new one to `SoulLinkState.handle_event` as a deep
copy, and keeps a deep-copied SNAPSHOT of both players' server-side model immediately after EACH event. Per-event
snapshots matter: a later tick can repair the model, so only the intermediate states show that a bad NACK re-boxed
the partner or dropped a rebuild key.

The only thing seeded rather than observed is the Soul Link pair itself (`seed_pair`): the link, its index and the
server's party model for the partner are written directly. Also seeded by the tests that use them: a minimal rebuild record (`seed_rebuild`, an unlinked phantom
key in part 1 keeps the rebuild open) and, where stated, death/count bookkeeping. That is a SEEDED fixture, not an admission and not a
natural capture.

Delivery is never faked: a server command reaches the client only through the state's own tick reply
(`deliver`), which arms sync_inflight exactly as server.py does, and the returned dict goes UNCHANGED to
`rig.send_command`.
