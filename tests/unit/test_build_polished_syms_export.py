"""tools/build_polished_syms.py: the export tree delete must be retrying and fail-closed.

Round-1 root cause (card cx-52f61773): `export_source` called `shutil.rmtree` on a shared cache
tree. A concurrent build left a directory non-empty, rmtree raised WinError 145, and the build
continued onto a HALF-DELETED tree -- which surfaced much later as make failing on files that
demonstrably existed. These tests pin the two properties that fix it: transient failures are
retried, and a tree that will not go away stops the build instead of corrupting it.
