"""A `seq` counter belongs to a TCP connection, and a connection proves itself with hello.

The live `reconnect_new` run found both halves missing at once. Slot A's same-save relaunch
sent nine messages and was killed; a DIFFERENT cartridge then connected as slot A and sent
`hello` with seq 1. The old guard compared that seq against the *slot's* last seq across
connections, and its restart escape hatch only fired for `seq <= 1 and last > 10` — nine is
not more than ten, so the hello was dropped as a duplicate with no log line at all. Every
later tick carried seq > last, so it sailed through with no accepted hello behind it, and at
12:14:23 the unidentified cartridge's party reconciled as slot A and discarded the run's
linked keys.

So: the counter resets with the connection, and nothing but hello is listened to until this
connection has said hello.
