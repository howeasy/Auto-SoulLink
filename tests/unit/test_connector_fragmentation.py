"""lua/connector.lua must survive a line that does not cross the socket in one piece.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The transport is newline-delimited JSON over a non-blocking socket, and
with settimeout(0) LuaSocket may move only PART of a line, reporting how far it got in its
third return value. Both directions used to discard that value:

  * send: the whole line stayed queued, so the next frame re-sent bytes the peer already
    had -- duplicating a prefix in the middle of the stream.
  * receive: the partial was dropped, and LuaSocket had already taken those bytes off the
    socket, so they were gone. The next complete line then arrived with its head missing.

Neither ever fired in practice, because a small JSON line crosses loopback atomically. That
made "lines are small" an unexamined assumption rather than a design, and the Gen 1 ROM
content payload is kilobytes. So this drives connector.lua under lupa with a mock socket
that fragments deliberately.

Every test here was checked against the PRE-FIX connector and fails there -- a
fragmentation test that passes on broken code is worse than none.

# ── the Gen 3 production client over the SAME fragmenting connector (P4 card C4-5) ─────────
#
# Every test above proves connector.lua reassembles a fragmented line for a hand-authored
# c.send/c.receive script. This drives the same fragmenting mock through the REAL Gen 3
# client's own frame_end (lua/gen3/client.lua over lua/core/session.lua) -- the production
# lua/gen3/entry.lua build, not a stand-in -- so the client's own send()/receive() calls (not
# a test script's) are what gets fragmented and reassembled.
#
# tests/unit/gen3_world.py's World wires its own stub `net` with no hook to substitute a real
# connector (a read-only file for this card; a `net` override hook there is worth adding
# later, filed as a follow-up rather than edited here -- docs/gen3/research/
# p4_gen1_contract_map.md §4.3: "if it lacks a hook you need, report it"), so this builds the
# smallest real client directly against lua/gen3/entry.lua, reusing gen3_world.py's own
# pack-loading helpers and pointer/predicate offsets (duplicated from
# test_connector_reconnect.py's own copy rather than imported: the two files' mock sockets
# have deliberately different shapes -- chunked send/receive here, hard-fail there -- and
# each file stays self-contained about which one it drives).
