"""The panel capability is a fact about a CARTRIDGE and must survive every message.

`connected_players[pid]` is rebuilt from scratch on every inbound line, and `panel` /
`panel_abi` are written only on the hello branch. So the capability lived for exactly one
message: the first tick after connecting erased it, `_player_has_panel` fell through to its
"client predates the capability report" default, and that default asks
`info_panel_width() == 0`. Gen 1 answers 20, so it returned False.

The player-visible result was a panel that showed the run as it stood at connect and never
updated again -- and it looked like a Lua bug, because the client really was painting
faithfully whatever it last received. Gen 3 was immune by accident: it never overrides
`info_panel_width`, so its default is 0 and the fallback answered True.

These tests drive the capability through the same rebuild the message loop performs, rather
than setting `connected_players` and asking the getter -- which is what every existing panel
test does, and why none of them could see this.
