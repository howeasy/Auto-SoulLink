"""POL-SOUNDS: the Polished Crystal overlay's native notification sounds.

Three layers, each proved against the artifact it claims to describe:

1. THE OVERLAY ROM (patch/dist/SLink-Polished.ups on the pinned release). The sound service is
   really in the shipped image: the semantic-code table, the SFX caps bit, the reset latch, the
   same-size SoftReset rewrite, and the fact that every changed byte lies in an intended span.
2. THE PROFILE (data/games/polished_crystal/profile.json). The semantic-code -> native-id table
   and the PlaySFX/CheckSFX/wMusicFade addresses are read out of the pinned Polished source and
   the overlay .sym, never written by hand.
3. THE HOST WRITER (lua/gen2/polished_sounds.lua). Its permit is built HERE, over the same
   lua/write_permit.lua the production writers use, against a synthetic System Bus image: one
   byte may be written (the request), every other mailbox byte and the tilemap are refused.

compose_polished still hands its panel a REFUSE-ALL writer (hardening H1) and this module does
not change that; the mailbox-only permit below is what the coordinator wires, tested here.
