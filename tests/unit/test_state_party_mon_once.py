B's client executed two `party_mon` for one key and acked twice
(`party_mon=2 sync_retrieve_done=2` in the receipt); the second withdraw was a
no-op only because the cartridge side happens to be idempotent.

These are shared-runtime lifecycle tests: they assert in reconciler passes, never
in frames, seconds or client events, and reference no generation's client.
