"""The Manager must not tell a Gen 1 player that a feature needs a ROM patch it doesn't.

Explode Mode and Rival Swap once sat under a heading that said "These need the companion
ROM patch applied to BOTH players' games". That is true on Gen 3, where gEnemyParty is
encrypted and checksummed, and false on Gen 1, where the enemy party is plaintext at a
fixed address and the move choice is a plain RAM write — both are live-tested that way by
the `rivalswap` and `explode_g1` duo scenarios.

The New-run form now names the game family up front and greys what that family cannot
honour, with the reason on the option. That knowledge is one table, `OPTION_SUPPORT`, read
through `option_support()`; these tests pin that its answers stay accurate.
