"""Every registered GET route must render without blowing up.

Nothing in the suite rendered a page before this. `server/server.py` is 8000 lines of Jinja
context building behind ~90 routes, and template/context breakage is the regression class this
repo is most exposed to — a renamed field or a missing macro takes a page (or an OBS overlay
mid-stream) down and no test notices.

The list of routes is not written out here; it is walked off `build_app()`'s real router, so a
route added to the server is covered automatically instead of drifting away from a hand-kept copy.
