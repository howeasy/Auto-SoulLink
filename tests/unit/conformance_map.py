"""Item-level evidence map for docs/protocol.md §9 (the 47-item conformance checklist).

One entry per checklist item (1-47, plus 38a/38b since the doc splits 38 into two rows).
`evidence_layer` records which lane ultimately proves the item, per PLAN §5.6:

  * "transport" (items 1-7): stream mechanics -- production connector tests
    (test_connector_fragmentation.py / test_connector_reconnect.py).
  * "world" (items 8-38 incl. 38a/38b): payload/admission logic, the semantic reducer, and
    the deaths/keys rules -- driven by a lupa fake-server harness against injected signals.
  * "live" (items 39-47): measured UI/input, post-scene evidence, or a rival-swap readback --
    only a running emulator can settle these.

Golden wire transcripts (tests/fixtures/gen3/wire/*.jsonl, produced by card C1-3) are
*characterization* evidence layered on top of "world" items where the wire shape is fully
visible from the transcript alone -- never a replacement evidence_layer of their own (PLAN
§5.6: "never a complete oracle"). `transcript_check` names the checker function in
test_protocol_conformance.py that applies to a transcript, or None if the item cannot be
judged from a transcript (e.g. it needs RAM state, not just wire lines).
