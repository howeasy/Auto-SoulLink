"""Two-instance Gen 1 E2E for the NEW client (lua/gen1/*): patched Red as player A, patched Blue
as player B (the SLink companion is required; a clean Red/Blue is refused).

    SLINK_E2E=1 pytest tests/e2e/test_duo_gen1_new.py -q

docs/gen1_requirements.md D-1 (encounter link) and D-3 (dead zone) from real play: a
throwaway server plus two EmuHawk instances running the production client built through
lua/gen1/entry.lua, walking Route 1's grass and throwing the fixture's single Poke Ball. The
runner (tools/e2e_duo.py, game gen1_new) reads the verdict off the SERVER, never off the client.

Skipped, never hung, when a prerequisite is missing: no EmuHawk, no cartridge dumps (they
are gitignored), or the battle fixtures not built. A missing COMPANION build next to present
dumps FAILS (`companion_problems`): the companion is the cartridge, not an optional extra.
