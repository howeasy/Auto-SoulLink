; TITLE-VERSION for Polished Crystal (docs/polished/TITLE.md 8.4): the patch version on the
; New Game / Continue menu, printed ONCE PER PASS of MainMenuJoypadLoop's .loop.
;
; Why per-pass and not once at SetUpMenu: with a save present and the RTC unset, SpeechTextbox rows
; 12-17 are redrawn every pass, so a one-time print is erased (TITLE.md 8.3). The hook is a SAME-SIZE
; rewrite of the 3-byte `call MainMenu_PrintCurrentTimeAndDay` (main_menu.asm:107, flat 0x483CD,
; bytes cd ed 43) to `call SlinkMainMenuLoopBridge`.
;
; The bridge calls the original first, then re-arms hBGMapMode around our print. Per TITLE.md's
; coordinator correction that pair is HYGIENE, not visibility: UpdateBGMap (home/video.asm:148-166)
; treats hBGMapMode 1 as "copy wTilemap to VRAM in halves each VBlank". The wrapper only avoids a
; one-frame tear against the clock text.
;
; Space: ROM0[$3F92] -- AFTER the phone bridge ($3F34..$3F8D), the last free ROM0 gap.
; NOT $0089: the integration merge gave patch/polished/src/slink_sfx.asm its own
; `SECTION "Slink Sound Reset", ROM0[$0089]`, so $0089 is taken and rgblink aborts with
; "section overlaps". Measured free by whole-ROM diff against the clean ROM; rgblink fails closed
; if anything else claims it.
