; SLink companion overlay -- Polished Crystal v3.2.3 in-game panel (card POL-PANEL, Stage 2).
;
; The handshake is the shared GB one, unchanged: PANEL_STATE / PANEL_PAGE / PANEL_PAGES at
; wSlinkMailbox +9/+10/+11 (patch/gb/slink_abi.inc), AWAIT then STAGED, and A advances while B
; closes. Only the PAYLOAD differs from the vanilla Crystal overlay's panel, and it is the whole
; reason this file exists:
;
; Vanilla's panel is a lease on a graphics buffer. The host paints wTileMap/wAttrmap while the
; screen is hidden and the cartridge reveals it with WaitBGMap2. Polished has no WaitBGMap2
; (docs/polished/PANEL.md E7: "the port's central unknown"), so that port is blocked on a
; transfer primitive nobody has measured. This panel sidesteps it entirely by moving TEXT and not
; pixels: the host writes the page into the mailbox in the game's own charmap and the ROM hands
; it to PrintText. The text engine owns the tilemap (SetUpTextbox -> ClearSpeechBox ->
; ApplyTilemap), so there is no tile transfer, no new graphics tile, no hBGMapMode handshake and
; no attribute map -- and the page is a native text box, with the game's border, palettes, blink
; arrow and per-frame print, which is what "feel vanilla" actually means here.
;
; Wire: wSlinkPanelText (mailbox +34) is SLINK_PANEL_LINES fixed-stride lines of
; SLINK_PANEL_LINE_MAX glyphs, each closed by the game's string terminator (charmap `@`, $53).
; Both lines are space-padded by the host, so a page always fully overwrites the fallback below.
DEF SLINK_PANEL_LINES EQU 2
DEF SLINK_PANEL_LINE_MAX EQU 16
DEF SLINK_PANEL_STRIDE EQU SLINK_PANEL_LINE_MAX + 1
ASSERT SLINK_OFS_PANEL_TEXT + SLINK_PANEL_LINES * SLINK_PANEL_STRIDE <= SLINK_MAILBOX_SIZE

	; columns too far right and wrapped past the box edge: live C2/C3 screen, "PAR|TNER: RED".
	; home/text.asm HandleLineBreak advances the string's STARTING coords, not the cursor.) The text box,
	; its border and palette are already up from the fallback's PrintText; both lines are space-padded
	; to exactly SLINK_PANEL_LINE_MAX glyphs so they fully overwrite the fallback. Line 2 sits ONE row below line 1
	; (the old <LNBRK> was NO_LINE_SPACING: one row; the first fix used +2 and left the fallback's `NO CLIENT` on the
	; row in between: live C2 'fallback second line is gone' FAIL).
	; The ROM does not trust the mailbox: force the string terminator at offset SLINK_PANEL_LINE_MAX of BOTH lines so a
