"""Independent Gen 2 duo witness, link and faint-propagation oracles (H2/H5).

`faint_oracle` decodes immutable LINK_SAVE images and final native saves, requires
A's production battle_faint plus a DEAD server pair and force_faint issuance, and
verifies B's measured checkpoint, permit spans and exact status/HP byte delta.
`on_verified`, when supplied to either scenario oracle, receives the decoded
{a, b, area, titles, status} facts only after every check passes; return stays None.
Gen 2 case/title and boot-file SHA-256 bindings are mandatory, including when the
runner supplies qualified per-side OT IDs and boot fixtures.

Both functions are PLAIN, testable without an emulator or a DuoRun instance. Codex wires them
into tools/e2e_duo.py as thin bound-method wrappers, because tools/duo_oracle_pipeline.py
resolves `EvidenceContract` callbacks via `getattr(owner, name)` -- the registered name must be
a real method on the runner:

    # tools/e2e_duo.py, on the DuoRun class:
    def check_gen2_save_witness(self, results):
        return gen2_duo_oracles.check_save_witness(results)

    def assert_gen2_link_saved(self, results, **kwargs):
        return gen2_duo_oracles.link_oracle(results, data_dir=self.data_dir, **kwargs)

    FAMILY_EVIDENCE["gen2_new"] = EvidenceContract("check_gen2_save_witness", require_oracle=True)
    # SCENARIOS["link"] (gen2_new family) row: "oracle": "assert_gen2_link_saved",
    # "oracle_kwargs": {} -- {} is correct for EVERY title pairing (C<->C, G<->S, C<->G, O-16):
    # no shared title is supplied by the caller. Each side's
    # title/fixture/expected-OT are derived from that side's OWN result-text markers (below), so the
    # same static oracle_kwargs row serves every GAMES pairing without per-lane configuration.

Both raise RuntimeError (never return False) naming the instance and the exact reason on any
refusal; both return None on success. `validate_pipeline` binds `witness(results)` with zero
kwargs and `oracle(results, **oracle_kwargs)`, so `check_save_witness` takes exactly one
positional argument and every other `link_oracle` parameter besides `results` must be a keyword.

## Per-instance result-text markers this module parses (H1 driver contract, fixed 2026-09-23)

One JSON object on the same line as its tag, in each instance's `results[inst]` text
(`D.result`); the LAST occurrence of a repeated tag wins:

- `DUO_GEN2 {...}`: player, scenario, attempt, case, title, rom_sha1, fixture_sha256. `case` names
  the committed boot fixture 1:1 (tests/fixtures/gen2/<case>.SaveRAM, e.g. "gold_battle") -- this
  is where a title's boot save comes from when the caller does not override it.
- `SAVE_WITNESS {...}`: frame, save_completed_frame, gate_saves, client_saves, cartram_sha256
  (sha256 of CartRAM[0:0x8000] -- the first 32768 bytes of the flushed file), cartram_bytes
  (32768), saveram_path (absolute, forward slashes), saveram_bytes (32768 + 22 = 32790, the
  22-byte RTC trailer included), flushed_matches (bool, the driver's own claim -- re-verified
  here independently, never trusted alone). Optional snapshot_path names an immutable raw
  CartRAM or full SaveRAM image, authenticated against cartram_sha256 before scratch comparison.
- `CLIENT {...}`: qualification, production_admitted, pack, title ("crystal"/"gold"/"silver"),
  rom_sha1. `title` selects the gen2_codec layout for THIS side only -- Gold/Silver/Crystal never
  share a layout even when they share an area id (route_29 is title-independent, the party/save
  struct offsets are not).
- `HELLO {...}`: frame, ot_id. The client's own trainer id, reported at connect time before any
  capture -- this is where a title's expected captured-mon OT id comes from when the caller does
  not override it (a self-caught wild mon's OT is always its own trainer's id).
- `RECEIPT {...}`: PASS-only; schema, header, title, rom_sha1, ... . Cross-checked against
  CLIENT/DUO_GEN2 when present; never required, since a FAIL run has no RECEIPT line.
- `ENGINE_CAPTURE {...}`: frame, site_id, acquisition, area_id, destination, slot, key,
  species_id, level. Cross-checked against the independently PYDEC-decoded flushed party.

### Per-side title, never a caller argument

Neither function accepts a `title` parameter. Each side's title is derived from that instance's
OWN markers and cross-checked for internal agreement (`_boot_marker`): DUO_GEN2.title must equal
CLIENT.title (same rom_sha1), and RECEIPT.title/rom_sha1 must agree too when a RECEIPT line is
present. A mismatch is refused, never silently resolved by trusting one marker over another --
this catches a driver that started the wrong title's client, or mixed up which side's result text
is which, independently of the H1 driver's own `SLINK_GEN2_TITLE` self-check. The two sides may
be different titles (Gold<->Silver, Crystal<->Gold, owner ruling O-16): `for_foundation` is called
per instance with ITS OWN cross-checked title, never a shared/assumed one.

`ot_ids` and `boot_saveram` accept the runner's qualified per-instance preflight data.
Standalone callers may omit them and derive them from HELLO.ot_id / DUO_GEN2.case;
either path requires the marker's fixture_sha256 to match the complete boot file.

`check_save_witness` only needs `SAVE_WITNESS` + `CLIENT` + `DUO_GEN2` (saveram_path is absolute,
so no runner/data_dir dependency). `link_oracle` additionally needs `HELLO`, `ENGINE_CAPTURE`, the
two boot fixtures (committed SaveRAM this scenario always boots from) and the server's persisted
`links.json` under `data_dir`.

### Removed guard: "OT ids must differ" (H2b carry, see git log -p / commit 23fbc80e)

An earlier revision refused up front when the (then caller-supplied) `ot_ids` mapping had equal
values for "a" and "b". That guard validated the CALLER'S input, not any observed evidence, so a
mistaken-but-harmless ot_ids argument would abort the oracle before it read a single byte of
either save -- and conversely proved nothing about whether the two sides actually caught the same
mon, since the DECODED saves were never consulted. It was removed once the real invariant already
had a fitting check a few lines later: `decoded["a"]["key"] == decoded["b"]["key"]`, which compares
the two INDEPENDENTLY PYDEC-decoded full identity keys (DV:OT:species) and refuses if they match.
That check is grounded in the flushed saves themselves, catches the identical-capture case the old
guard was trying to catch, and (unlike the old guard) still works now that ot_ids is normally
derived per side from each instance's own HELLO marker rather than supplied as one shared mapping.
