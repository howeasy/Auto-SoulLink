"""Which production code a Gen 2 receipt was earned on (card CODE-DIGEST).

A receipt that binds only fixture bytes and the clean ROM sha1 stays "valid" after the client or
server changes under it. A runner records `run_stamp()` next to its verdict, and
tools/verify_gen2_release.py compares that stamp's digest with `head_digest()`: when they differ,
the receipt is STALE.

The digest is sha256 over the sorted "<path> <git blob id>" lines of every tracked production file
at HEAD. It is exact, and cheap because git already hashed the content. It only binds the tree the
runner ran on when that tree is clean for these paths, so run_stamp() also records the dirty
production paths. The verifier treats any dirty stamp as STALE.
