"""tools/gen_polished_engine_sites.py — the Polished Crystal 3.2.3 engine-site and
write-checkpoint packs, the Polished equivalents of `data/games/gen2_crystal/engine_signals.json`
and `data/games/gen2_crystal/write_checkpoint.json`.

Every offset comes from the pinned release build (`data/polished/polishedcrystal.sym`
+ `release/polishedcrystal-3.2.3.gbc`), and every `expected_hex` is READ OUT OF THE ROM at
generation time — never hand-typed. Sites with no verified counterpart are emitted with
`status: UNRESOLVED` and a reason; they are never guessed.

The companion overlay (`patch/dist/SLink-Polished.ups` applied to the release ROM via
`patch/tools/make_ups.ups_apply`) is diffed against the release and every resolved site is
asserted to lie outside the changed spans, so a site byte can never be a patched byte.

Schemas mirror the vanilla packs: `polished-engine-signals-v1` (site keys
signal/kind/symbol/symbol_offset/bank/addr/rom_offset/expected_hex/phase/semantics/
event_role/maturity/physical_firing/runtime_enabled/status/reason) and
`polished-write-checkpoint-v1`.

Usage:
    python tools/gen_polished_engine_sites.py            # write both packs
    python tools/gen_polished_engine_sites.py --check    # exit 1 if either is stale
    python tools/gen_polished_engine_sites.py --roms DIR # override the ROM/sym directory
