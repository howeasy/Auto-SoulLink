tools/make_release.py — Build a player-facing SLink release package.

Creates dist/SLink-player-<version>.zip containing only the files a
non-hosting player needs to run SLink in BizHawk:
  - lua/   (clients, shared modules, area tables — no tests)
  - data/games/<gen>/  (area/location tables and the Gen 1 client's JSON data,
    loaded via _proj_root path)
  - PLAYER_SETUP.md
  - LICENSE, NOTICE.md

The server (Python), test suite, code-generation tools, and server-only
JSON data files are intentionally excluded.

Optionally (RR players) it also bundles, under companion/:
  - patch/dist/SLink-RR.ups   (the native code-injection patch)   [--with-patch]
  - the patch guide
  - a pre-patched ROM                                              [--rom <path>]

Every companion shows "SoulLink <version>" on its game's main menu, so a release must carry its own version:
run `python tools/stamp_release.py --version vX.Y.Z` first (it rebuilds and re-pins every companion; commit the result, then
tag). Bundling companions that patch/dist/companion_version.json does not vouch for under this --version is refused
(--allow-unstamped-companions overrides).

Usage:
    python tools/make_release.py
    python tools/make_release.py --version 1.2.3
    python tools/make_release.py --version 1.2.3 --out dist/
    python tools/make_release.py --host 192.168.1.10 --port 54321 --player b
    python tools/make_release.py --with-patch
    python tools/make_release.py --rom patch/build/slink_RR.gba   # patch + ROM

The optional --host/--port/--player flags bake connection settings directly
into the launcher scripts (slink_gen*.lua) as a convenience. The recommended
flow is for players to download a pre-configured launcher from the host's
status page instead.

# SLink player setup

This package contains everything you need to play a Soul Link Nuzlocke with
SLink in BizHawk. You don't need Python: the host runs the server.

---

## What you need

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| BizHawk | BIZHAWK_REQ (older versions refuse to start). https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/releases |
| A writable folder | Unzip somewhere you can write (not Program Files): Gen 3 keeps a small session file next to `lua/`. |
| Your cartridge | The one your host prepared in the SLink Manager (download it from the run's page). Red/Blue, pureRGB, Gold/Silver/Crystal, FireRed/LeafGreen/Emerald and Radical Red must carry the SLink patch; the Manager adds it. Yellow is played clean. |
| LuaSocket DLL | Already in `lua/x64/`. If missing, see the note below. |
"""

# A pack the Manager built already holds the player's launcher.
_GUIDE_STEP1_PACKED = """\
| Launcher script | `LAUNCHER`, already in this folder. |

---

## Step 1: your launcher is already here

`LAUNCHER` sits next to `lua/` and `data/` in this folder. It connects to
`CONNECT` as Player PLAYER. Keep it in this folder: it finds the rest of
SLink next to itself. If your host's address changes, download a fresh pack.

---

"""

_GUIDE_STEP1_DOWNLOAD = """\
| Launcher script | Download from your host's SLink Manager (see Step 1). |

---

## Step 1: download your launcher from the host

Your host will share their **SLink Manager** page, which looks like:

```
http://<host-ip>:8090/
```

On the run's page, open **Launchers** and download the `.lua` for your
player slot (Player A or Player B). It is pre-configured with the address,
game TCP port and slot the run expects. The **setup .zip** in the same menu
is this whole package with the launcher already inside.

**Save that file into this folder**, the same folder that contains `lua/`
and `data/`. For example:

```
SLink-player-<version>/
├── slink_MyRun_a.lua   ← place the downloaded launcher here
├── lua/
└── data/
```

---

"""

_GUIDE_REST = """\
## Step 2: load in BizHawk

1. Open BizHawk and load your save file.
2. Open **Tools → Lua Console**.
3. Choose **Script → Open Script…** and select your launcher `.lua` (Step 1).
4. The console will print:

   ```
   [SLink] TCP connected to <host>:<port>
   ```

   If it prints `TCP connecting… (non-blocking)` briefly first, that is
   normal. It connects within a second or two.

> **Important:** Load your save file *before* opening the Lua script.
> The script validates save data at startup. If the save isn't loaded yet,
> writes are disabled until validation passes (it retries automatically).

---

## If the LuaSocket DLL is missing

The file `lua/x64/socket-windows-5-4.dll` is required and ships in this
package. If it is absent, download the setup ZIP from your host again.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `BizHawk … is too old for Gen 1` | Install BizHawk GEN1_MIN or newer. |
| `module 'socket' not found` | `socket-windows-5-4.dll` is missing from `lua/x64/`. See above. |
| `TCP connect failed` / retrying | Server is not running, or IP/port is wrong. Ask host to verify. |
| Connected but nothing happens | Check with host that your player slot (A or B) is not already taken. |
| Writes disabled / validation failed | Load your save file **before** the Lua script. |
| `… needs the SLink companion patch` | This cartridge isn't patched, or was patched by an earlier SLink. Use the cartridge your host prepared, or patch it at `/patcher` on the host's Manager. |
| `Wrong save!` on screen | You loaded a different save file than the one registered for your slot. |
| Folder picker appears | Put the launcher `.lua` file inside the extracted `SLink-player-*` folder, next to `lua/`. |

---

## What SLink does automatically

- Your first catch on a route is permanently
  paired with your partner's first catch on the same route.
- When your linked partner faints, so does yours.
- If either player fails to catch on a route, the route is closed
  for both of you.
- Fallen pairs are moved to a memorial box once both games are
  somewhere safe.

You play normally. SLink enforces the rules for you.
