docs/gen3/G4_final_cut_runbook.md §0-§11 is the source of every row; §12 names the gaps this closes.
--title rr (card G5-RUNNER-RR) is a separate, opt-in plan: the RR duo rows (every
tools/e2e_duo.py SCENARIOS entry whose games includes gen3_rr, minus the owner-signed
linked_faint_active_mega_gen3 limit), the RR opcode gates, and the release zip built, checked
and booted on the RR companion (rr_zip_build, rr_zip_check, zip_boot_radicalred); its summary is
fc_SUMMARY_<cut8>_rr.txt. --title emerald (card E4b-FINALCUT, docs/gen3_emerald/PLAN.md §5 E4b) is
a third, opt-in plan: the SOURCE-lane generator checks, the Emerald states/duo/bootcheck rows, the
Emerald-only slice of the probe-gates live suite, the shadow-negatives manifest check, and the
release zip built, checked and booted on Emerald (emerald_zip_build, emerald_zip_check,
zip_boot_emerald); its summary is fc_SUMMARY_<cut8>_emerald.txt. §13 of the runbook is its source.
--title exp is XG3's test-only reference-build plan: source checks, expansion units, every
applicable duo registry entry, and ZIP build/check/boot. Its summary is
fc_SUMMARY_<cut8>_exp.txt. Runtime rows must log the server's --test-only-route; ZIP boot also
logs the existing duo client-admission seam. Source/build rows use no runtime route. This
plan does not open production admission or replace XG3's separate observer/calc obligations.
EG4 (ruling 24) landed lua/gen3/entry.lua:108's Entry.ROUTED gen3_emerald admission, so
zip_boot_emerald now actually boots Emerald like any other title. zip_boot() still checks the
EXTRACTED zip's own entry.lua before attempting the boot (emerald_admission_blocker) and reports
SKIP-ALLOWED BLOCKED-EG4 (not a silent skip, not a PASS) if that particular zip predates EG4 --
a real possibility when re-running an old --cut, just no longer the expected outcome on a current
one. --title defaults to "frlg", so the default plan and its row ids are unchanged.
Sequential, one emulator lane (docs/gen3/PLAN.md:23). Order: provision the lane at --cut (and the
master tree when item 6 is selected), then every selected row in runbook order. Each row writes
docs/gen3/probes/fc_<row>_<cut8>.txt through gen3_probe_receipt.run_receipt_text, and the pass
rewrites docs/gen3/probes/fc_SUMMARY_<cut8>.txt after every row.

Rules this runner enforces itself:
  - the lane must be at --cut with `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no` empty, or the
    pass aborts before any row; a row that leaves the lane tracked-dirty fails and aborts the pass;
  - an unchanged failed row is never re-run automatically: one retry only when the failure is a
    CPU-contention timeout (classify_failure), and a FAIL receipt at the same cut blocks the row
    on later invocations too (move the receipt aside to re-run it deliberately);
  - it kills only the process trees it launched (taskkill /PID <its own child> /T), never by name;
  - rewind off: every BizHawk config a row wrote under the lane's patch/build is read back and a
    `Rewind.Enabled` that is not false fails the row;
  - a SKIP is a failure unless ALLOWED_SKIPS names the row with an owner ruling.

Helper subcommands the plan itself calls (they are rows like any other):
    python tools/gen3_final_cut.py zip-boot --zip <zip> --lane <lane>        (runbook §9 boot step)
    python tools/gen3_final_cut.py item6 --branch <lane> --master <tree>     (runbook §10)

# G4-FINALCUT-HARDEN after OMP's review of d9a08f5b). A row is CARRIED, not run, only when ALL of:
#   - a citable PASS receipt for the same row+orientation exists at a cut X (one unambiguous final
#     verdict; a CARRIED fc receipt is citable only through its validated origin);
#   - X is an ancestor of the cut (`git merge-base --is-ancestor X cut`);

#     client closure, the packs it loads, the harness and carriers, the server, the fixtures, the
#     pret syms -- when in doubt the path is in; `**` crosses directories, `*` does not);
#   - the non-git inputs (staged ROMs, ...) hash the same in this lane as the receipt recorded.
