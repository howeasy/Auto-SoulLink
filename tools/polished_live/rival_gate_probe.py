"""Read-only Polished rival gate callback-PC probe; authoring does not authorize a live run.

    python tools/polished_live/rival_gate_probe.py --setup played --fixture SAVE --route route.json
    python tools/polished_live/rival_gate_probe.py --setup synth --disclosure D.json --fixture SAVE --route route.json         [--expect rival|wild]

--setup played: the fixture is native SaveRAM and the generic callback-PC oracle applies, unchanged.
--setup synth (O-33): the fixture is a tool-built SYNTH derivative (tools/polished_live/derive_rival_save.py) and
--disclosure is that builder's disclosure JSON; its SHA-256 must name the fixture (as its output = the staged scene
save, or as its input = the control run on the declared source) and its file hash is written into the trace
and checked by the oracle. Synth refuses to run without it. Only the setup is synthetic: the battle runs natively.
  --expect rival (default): the stronger rival-card oracle (evaluate_rival).
  --expect wild: the wild-battle control (evaluate_wild_control).

The fixture is native SaveRAM. The route starts at emulator boot and must include any
CONTINUE/menu input needed to reach a real trainer battle. No route means bounded idle.
Route JSON: {"steps": [{"frames": 120, "buttons": []}, {"frames": 2, "buttons": ["A"]}]}.
Each step holds exactly those buttons for its frame count; remaining frames are idle.
No SLink client/server, forced battle, WRAM setup, warp, or CPU manipulation is used.
A fresh private lane is staged per invocation; only harness.launch's own PID is killed.
The Lua RESULT certifies recording completion, not the PC finding. The oracle owns that verdict.
