"""Comprehensive mock data injector — populates every widget with realistic
state for visual testing. Run while the SLink server is listening on
TCP 54321 and HTTP 8080 (the defaults).

What you get after running:
* Both players (Alice / Bob) connected, FireRed / LeafGreen
* 6 linked party pairs (12 mons total) across routes 1-6
* 1 dead-zone link at route7 (Alice missed) → Memorial + Killfeed populate
* 1 boxed-link pair (route8) → Boxed Links populates
* 1 active battle on player B vs a wild Caterpie → Enemy widget
* 1 shiny captured → Shiny Counter shows ≥ 1
* Attempt counter set to 7
* Lock rules: species clause enabled

After running, refresh http://localhost:8099/ in your browser. If the
widgets still show "no data", call /api/reset first.

`--game gen1` swaps in a Red/Blue cast. `--game gen2 --title crystal|gold|silver` swaps
in a Johto cast on that title (both players), and adds one MEMORIAL pair (fainted, then
confirmed into the memorial box the way the client confirms a memorialize) beside the
DEAD one.

`--game gen3 --title firered_rr|frlg|emerald` picks the Gen 3 cartridge pair: firered_rr
(default, unchanged) is Radical Red on both sides; frlg is vanilla FireRed/LeafGreen
(the existing Kanto cast, just non-RR rom_types); emerald is vanilla Emerald on both
sides with its own Hoenn cast (Kanto area ids don't exist on that foundation).
