# Playing a Polished Crystal Soul Link

A two-player Soul Link Nuzlocke on **Polished Crystal v3.2.3**, run through the SLink Manager. Both
players play Polished Crystal; it does not link with vanilla Crystal, Gold or Silver. This page is
for players. The developer index is further down.

## What you need

- The **Polished Crystal v3.2.3** release ROM (`polishedcrystal-3.2.3.gbc`), one copy per player.
  Other versions and hacked or already-modified ROMs are not accepted.
- BizHawk, one instance per player, and Python for the SLink server. Randomizing also needs Java.
- You do not need to patch anything by hand. The Manager applies the SLink companion patch to each
  cartridge it prepares. A clean, unpatched Polished ROM is refused when it connects. If you would
  rather patch yourself, the Manager's `/patcher` page has a "Polished Crystal" target.

## Starting a run

1. Open the Manager and choose **New run**.
2. Give the run a name and pick the game **Polished Crystal**.
3. Tick the options you want (see Options below).
4. In **Cartridges**, pick each player's Polished Crystal ROM. The Manager lists the ROMs it finds in
   the SLink folder and lets you add a file.
5. Optionally turn on **Randomize** (see Randomizer below).
6. Press **Create and prepare cartridges** (or **Create run** if you are not randomizing). The run's
   server starts and the Manager makes each player a patched cartridge.
7. Each player downloads their cartridge and their launcher script from the run page. Load the
   cartridge in BizHawk, then load the launcher script in the Lua console. It connects to the run.
8. Play. Rules switch on once you have Poke Balls. Your first catch in an area, and your partner's
   first catch in the same area, become a pair.

## What the game does for you

- **Encounter linking.** The first Pokemon each of you catches in an area is permanently paired with
  the other player's. Gifts, hatched eggs, roaming legendary beasts and Bug-Catching Contest catches
  link under their own special areas rather than the route you happened to be on.
- **Dead zones.** If either of you fails to catch in an area, that area is closed for both of you.
- **Faint propagation.** When one half of a pair faints, the other half is fainted too. This is always
  on; there is no switch for it. A faint during the Bug-Catching Contest is held until the contest
  ends.
- **Whiteout.** If a player's whole party is wiped, the partners of everything still in their party
  are fainted too.
- **Party sync and box moves.** Linked Pokemon must be together: both in the party or both in a box.
  When one player deposits or withdraws a Pokemon, the other player's partner is moved to match.
  A move can be refused for a boxed egg or a Pokemon holding Mail.
- **Memorial box.** When a pair has died and both games are in a safe spot, both Pokemon are moved to
  Box 20. This is best-effort: if a burial is refused (for example the party has Mail on a later
  Pokemon, or Box 20 is full) the Pokemon stays where it is.
- **Optional clauses.** Species, Gender and Type clauses reject a link when the two Pokemon share an
  evolution family, a gender or a type.
- **Shiny pairs.** A shiny catch earns the partner an extra slot.

## Options in the Manager

- **Species / Gender / Type Clause.** The link clauses above.
- **Explode Mode.** When a partner dies, the linked Pokemon is made to use Explosion instead of just
  fainting. Needs the companion patch on both games. The plain faint rule is the fallback
  when the Explosion cannot be forced.
- **Rival Swap.** In rival battles you fight your partner's real team instead of the stock one.
  Works for the three Rival battles (RIVAL0, RIVAL1 and RIVAL2) only. Needs the companion on both
  games.
- **Native Sounds.** Short in-game notification sounds for Soul Link events, played through the
  game's own audio. Off by default.
- **Battle Calc.** A built-in damage calculator on the run's web page. For Polished it uses Gen 3
  mechanics on Polished's own Pokedex and type chart; abilities, held-item boosts and natures are
  not modelled, so treat results as an estimate. On by default.
- **Phone Calls, Native Messages, Overworld Presence** are not available for Polished Crystal.

## Randomizer

Polished Crystal can be randomized from the New run page. The Manager runs the SLink randomizer on
your ROM and gives each player a different randomized, patched cartridge. It can change: wild
encounters (with the usual restriction, legendary-blocking, minimum-catch-rate and level options),
starters, static and gift Pokemon, trainer teams (with similar-strength, rival-starter, no-legendary
and type-matching options) and in-game NPC trades. It does not change trainer levels, trainer or
class names, or trade nicknames, items, IVs and OTs, and it applies no misc tweaks.

## In-game features

- **Trade.** Trade at the Cable Club receptionist in a Pokemon Center. The patched game turns the
  counter into an SLink trade: pick the Pokemon you offer; your partner does the same at their own
  Pokemon Center; the swap happens in-game. There is nothing to switch on.
- **The "SLink" phone contact.** Open the Pokegear, go to the Phone tab, and pick the contact
  **SLink / Soul Link**. Choose **Call** and an in-game panel opens (it never rings). Press **A** for
  the next page and **B** to close. Each page is two short lines. The pages show: SOUL LINK, PAIRS
  (alive out of total), BADGES (out of 8), DEAD ZONES (a count, then each area by name), and then one
  line per pair, `yours-theirs`, with an X in front of a dead pair. With no server connected the panel
  says NO CLIENT.
- **Title screen.** The title screen carries a SoulLink wordmark, and the New Game / Continue menu
  shows the SoulLink patch version.
- **Sounds.** With Native Sounds on, Soul Link notifications play one of four short sounds (success,
  failure, a bad-news sound and a notification chime) through the game's own audio.

## Known limitations

- **Memorializing is best-effort** (see above). If a Pokemon stays put, move it yourself. Do not take
  Pokemon out of Box 20: the game revives a withdrawn Pokemon at full HP.
- **Trade has one tested path.** Trading one Pokemon each way in the normal case has been run. Odd
  cases (full boxes, interrupted connections, resets mid-trade) have not. Save before you trade.
- **Release stamping is pending.** The patch version shown on the menu is a development version
  until the first official release.
- **Not a finished release.** Polished Crystal support is a release candidate. Playthrough coverage
  is narrow, and it has been tested with a two-player Polished pair only.
- **Phone calls are not supported.** The SLink contact is a panel you open yourself; it does not ring
  when something happens.
- **Calculator limits** as above.
- **Native text boxes are small.** The panel shows 16 characters per line, so long Pokemon or area
  names are cut.

# docs/polished — developer index

Polished Crystal **v3.2.3** support: the SLink companion overlay, the pack, the ROM tables, and
the reverse-engineering record behind them.

**Reconciliation rule for this directory.** These documents were written one after another and
later ones overturned earlier statements. Nothing is deleted. Every superseded statement keeps its
original wording and carries a visible `SUPERSEDED (see X §n)` marker plus a one-line correction,
so a reader can see what was believed, when it was believed, and what replaced it.

Start at **[README](#1-documents)**, then the document your question needs. If two documents
disagree, **the later one wins** and the earlier one carries the marker.

## 1. Documents

| Doc | Purpose | Status | Authoritative for | Superseded |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ENGINE_SITES.md` | Engine signal sites and write checkpoints, vanilla→Polished mapping | current, reconciled | the site **inventory** and verdicts; §2's `battle_faint`/`trainer_ready` rows and §9 risks 2 and 4 are **marked superseded** | §2 `trainer_ready` (`.partyloop` is not the party build), §2 `battle_faint` (located at `0f:44ca`), §9 risk 2, §9 risk 4 |
| `BATTLE_FLOW.md` | `battle_faint` boundary, `battle_hold` oracles, write windows | current, reconciled | the faint boundary `0f:44ca`, the two hold oracles, the hold point before `call DetermineMoveOrder` | the `DetermineMoveOrder` priority UNVERIFIED note and the `wCurOTMon == $FF` rival gate are **marked superseded** (see `EXPLODE_RIVAL.md` §6–§7) |
| `EXPLODE_RIVAL.md` | Explode Mode and Rival Team Swap writers | **current, newest for battle writes** | `wCurPlayerMove` IS read via `GetBattleVarAddr`'s `BATTLE_VARS_MOVE` (§6); the rival gate is the PC at `0f:47dd` with the commit at `0f:47cc` and last consumption at `0f:480d` (§7); the trainer send-out copy site from ROM bytes (§10) | §1 is explicitly overturned by its own §6 |
| `HOOKS.md` | Companion overlay hook/edit sites and native symbols | current | the hook inventory (§2), the native symbol table (§3), where new code may be INCLUDEd (§4); §8 is the settled frame-hook correction | none outstanding — §9 records the reconciliation check that found none |
| `RAM.md` | RAM/structure map, Polished vs vanilla pokecrystal | current | symbol tables (§1), struct layouts (§2), species/badge encoding (§3); carries its own coordinator corrections (`CaughtLevel +29` / `CaughtLocation +30`, Kanto badge bits 4/5 swapped) | not edited by this pass; see [Mismatch](#4-mismatch) |
| `NEWBOX.md` | PC storage ("newbox") reader/writer spec | current | SRAM map (§1), box slot → pokedb entry (§2), per-entry checksum (§3), SLink operations (§6); 20 boxes, 20 entries per box | §8 carries the `docs/newbox_format.md` errata |
| `ROMTABLES.md` | ROM-side tables (wild/tree/fishing/roamers/statics) | current | the table addresses and record layouts | — |
| `CLIENT.md` | The Polished Lua client composition | current | client-side reads, profile/charmap wiring | — |
| `UPR_HANDLER.md` | The SLink fork of Pokémon Unbound Randomizer for Polished | current | what the randomizer may rewrite, and what it must not | — |
| `ACQUISITION_RULES.md` | Soul Link facts for Polished-only acquisition paths | current, **facts only — no decisions** | Wonder Trade, eggs, the 9 NPC trades, formed statics, swarms, and which identity mutations break a link key | — |

### The four markers added in this pass

1. `ENGINE_SITES.md` §2 `trainer_ready`: `.partyloop` is the **boss-trainer happiness walk**; the
   enemy party is built by `farcall ReadTrainerParty` at `core.asm:8040` (`BATTLE_FLOW.md` F5,
   `EXPLODE_RIVAL.md` §10).
2. `ENGINE_SITES.md` §2 `battle_faint`: located at **`0f:44ca`**, ROM-verified (`BATTLE_FLOW.md` §1).
3. `ENGINE_SITES.md` §9 risks 2 and 4: the `battle_hold` checkpoint is **not** blocked
   (`LostBattle` `0f:4ff6`, `HasPlayerFainted` `00:3684`), and `expected_hex` is now generated.
4. `BATTLE_FLOW.md`: `DetermineMoveOrder` **does** read `wCurPlayerMove`, and the rival gate is the
   **PC at `0f:47dd`**, not `wCurOTMon == $FF` (`EXPLODE_RIVAL.md` §6–§7).

## 2. Generated data

| File | Produced by | Check |
|---|---|---|
| `data/polished/polishedcrystal.sym` / `.map` | `tools/build_polished_syms.py` | `python tools/build_polished_syms.py --check` |
| `data/polished/polished_slink.sym` / `.map` | `tools/build_polished_companion.py` | `python tools/build_polished_companion.py --check` |
| `data/polished/build_provenance.json` | `tools/build_polished_syms.py` | as above |
| `data/polished/overlay_provenance.json` | `tools/build_polished_companion.py` | as above |
| `data/polished/upr_polished_entries.ini` | `tools/gen_upr_polished_ini.py` | `python tools/gen_upr_polished_ini.py --check` |

| `data/games/polished_crystal/engine_signals.json`, `write_checkpoint.json` | `tools/gen_polished_engine_sites.py` | `python tools/gen_polished_engine_sites.py --check` |

`ENGINE_SITES.md` §2 and §9 and `BATTLE_FLOW.md` are **human documents**: they describe the sites
and windows; the generated JSON is the artefact the runtime reads.

## 3. UPR patches

`patch/upr/` applies in order. `0016`–`0018` are the Polished ones:

| Patch | Adds |
|---|---|
| `0016-slink-Polished-Crystal-3.2.3-handler-cut-1.patch` | the Polished Crystal 3.2.3 ROM handler |
| `0017-slink-Polished-Crystal-wild-encounters.patch` | the eight wild-encounter tables |
| `0018-slink-Polished-Crystal-trainers-starters-statics-trades.patch` | trainer parties, starters, statics and the in-game trades |

`0001`–`0015` are the earlier pure/pureRGB overlays and are unrelated to Polished.
`tools/gen_upr_polished_ini.py` renders the offsets section UPR consumes; see `UPR_HANDLER.md`.

## 4. Mismatch

**`RAM.md:72` — `wTextboxFlags` bank.** RAM.md records `01:CFF4` in *both* the vanilla and the
Polished column and marks it `same`; `data/polished/polishedcrystal.sym:65521` places
`wTextboxFlags` at **`00:cff4`**. The address matches, the **bank does not**. RAM.md was outside this
pass's scope and is **not** edited here; a one-line correction is warranted. Every other symbol
sampled from RAM.md's tables (72 rows matched by exact name) agrees with the `.sym` — including the
row-43 control `wCurPlayerMove` vanilla `00:C6E3` → Polished `00:C540`.

## 5. Machine-checkable citations

Each entry names an absolute path, a line and an exact substring on that line.
