# Polished Crystal RC tracker

**Not an RC.** Historical 2026-10-05 verifier run: `python tools/verify_polished_release.py` failed 18 items: 5 OPEN
blocking items (`OPEN-WRITE-PATH`, `OPEN-EXPLODE-RIVAL`, `OPEN-TITLE-SPLASH`, `OPEN-PANEL-PAGES`,
`OPEN-IN-GAME-TRADE`), 11 LIVE receipts reported stale against that run's overlay, and the
BUILD-OVERLAY / MODEL-DATA cells (count from the 2026-10-05 coordinator run; this rewrite did not
re-run the verifier to completion). The reasons are in `RC_STATUS.md`. No row below is
**QUALIFIED ON THIS CUT**.

Rewritten 2026-10-05 against `claude/gen2-integration` HEAD `df26d343a` after a Codex source audit of
the previous table. Everything here was checked with grep, `ls`, `git log`, `git cat-file` and
`git merge-base --is-ancestor`. No emulator was run. Test counts are `pytest --collect-only`
counts (collected, not passed); no row claims a pass that was not run for this rewrite.

## Owner decisions (relayed by the coordinator; no owner-signed tree receipt)

Recorded 2026-10-08 from coordinator card `g2p-decisions`. These are relayed owner decisions, not implementation or live-qualification receipts.

**2026-10-06 — DECIDED**
* Explode/death enforcement: parity with the other generations **plus the plain-faint writer**, not universal visible Explosion.
* Three-outcome box-write contract: **GO, Gen 3 first**. Implementation/integration and qualification are separate gates.
* Full in-game trade plan: C5 commit + C6 responder, second-identity duo and cold reload. Commit **enablement for SYNTH duo testing needs a later, separate yes**; approval of the plan does not enable commit.
* Rival swap: **SYNTH staging authorised, disclosed**. This does not settle the rival class set or qualify the write.

**2026-10-07 — DECIDED**
* Incoming-mon rules: the **current validator only**; no extra admission policy.
* The dev build **never advertises trade in hello**.
* Uncertainty before APPLY: close the lease, log once, report **NOT-PERFORMED**. **UNCERTAIN** is reserved for after a commit starts; this decision is not a claim that every current implementation path complies.
* Vanilla Gen 2 APPLY hazards (discarded final APPLY frame; same-frame OFFER-answer + APPLY arm): fix in the **NEXT Gen 2 window**, batched as an inclusive **3600-frame ROM wait** plus the **host frame-gap guard**. Not a completed-fix claim for this Polished cut.
* Version stamp: **0.1.0 until the first live receipts**.
* Landing: **keep local; no master merge yet**. One reviewed landing after the box-contract merge, trade pump, commit step and a full verifier run; those prerequisites do not themselves authorise landing.

**Still UNDECIDED:** memorial NOT_COMPLETE semantics; box-20 retrieval policy + quarantine exception; last-healthy parity; rival class set; later stamping policy; commit enablement; landing/push/release.

## Vocabulary

| level | meaning |
|---|---|
| IMPLEMENTED | code is in the tree; it may have no test, or no live run |
| MODEL-TESTED | a unit test on disk exercises it (Python model, or Lua under lupa where the row says so); it never ran on a cartridge |
| LIVE-RUN | ran on an emulated cartridge in an older run, on the overlay sha1 named in the row. A sha1 is not a commit. These are DEV runs from `LIVE_RESULTS.md` or a lane result file, not PHYSICAL receipts |
| QUALIFIED ON THIS CUT | the verifier's live receipts for the CURRENT code and overlay are green. **No row has this level** |

**2026-10-08 later, card `g2p-rcclose` at `499d1cab9`: CURRENT overlay `688945795e2656019247f5aaceb7b1d8791e900a`, UPS 4166 B (title wordmark commit `1d750de2e`). Five DEV receipts bound to it and to the computed code digest `f8966ea4…` (`--print-code-digest`) PASS in the verifier: `LIVE-TITLE-SPLASH`, `LIVE-WRITES-OVERWORLD`, `LIVE-PANEL-PAGES-ROM`, `LIVE-PANEL-HELLO`, `LIVE-PANEL-HOST-PAGING`. `OPEN-TITLE-SPLASH` is CLOSED by `LIVE-TITLE-SPLASH`; `OPEN-WRITE-PATH` and `OPEN-PANEL-PAGES` stay OPEN on the points named in `tests/polished_release_requirements.json`. Rows below marked "on `68894579`" cite those receipts; everything else keeps its historical overlay.**

**2026-10-08 source update at `4281d18c5`: CURRENT overlay `cf03f53accefbc5f3fee9062846699e30c4c987b`, UPS 3767 B (`overlay_provenance.json:63,85-88`), from bounded-rollback commit `33f3b08bf` (merge `8d80f1ea3`). `877a477a` is the historical C5-body cut (`7f56228b5`); `97628616` is older still. Pin audit: `130 pins; 0 STALE executable pins`.** The `deebb100` text below is the historical reference for the "live on" column. The integrated overlay then was `data/polished/overlay_provenance.json` `output.sha1`,
`deebb1004d4f6123667d5d9e061ad0bf867ac021` (`deebb100`, commit `da7c9bad4`). The column "live on
`deebb100`?" is the marker for which rows were run live on that overlay and which only on an
older or lane overlay. Do not copy a sha1 between trees: read the file.

Older overlay sha1s that appear below (all are overlay sha1s, not commits): `29ea04c2` (Runs 1-3),
`34942315` (Phone Stage 1, `c9f1ad14f`), `9c60bc8f` (first panel build, `5ed073821`), `ac65532c`
(sound-only build, `ef7fdd60e`), `7461c828` (a pol-panel2 lane build; not committed as the
integrated overlay).

One bank-1 deposit only |
| party_mon withdraw | MODEL-TESTED (executor composed), LIVE-RUN on `68894579` (DEV): check (d) PASS in `LIVE-WRITES-OVERWORLD` (bank 1, one mon; exact diff, pokedb entry never freed). Earlier historical (d) PASS on `6e43f8d9` (`LIVE_WRITES.md`). Idempotent and dead-mon guarded (`WITHDRAW.md`).

HP comes back full and status cleared (engine behaviour) |
| force_faint (overworld) | MODEL-TESTED, LIVE-RUN on `68894579` (DEV): bench (a) PASS; the negatives (c) are **NOT RUN live**; no in-battle/PHYSICAL faint | YES for (a) on `68894579` (`LIVE-WRITES-OVERWORLD`: HP 0/0, status 0, count unchanged, 3 writes all in the target's bytes).

Manager still refuses the option (`server/manager.py:191-200`) | `test_polished_rival_path.py`; `LIVE_RESULTS.md:762-768`: frame 9125 qualified gate/next/last, SYNTH; production writer amendment `d4a4b6d1`. Class policy remains configurable |

| server adoption of randomized encounter tables | MODEL-TESTED, LIVE-RUN (Run 3 R2, older overlay) | NO | `server/adapters/gen2_polished.py:411-433` `ingest_rom_content` and `use_rom_encounters` (the server's own read of the Manager file, sha1 pinned; unreadable cartridge shows no encounters) | `tests/unit/test_polished_rand_data.py` (12); `LIVE_RESULTS.md` Run 3 |
| randomizer + UPR jar | MODEL-TESTED, LIVE-RUN (Run 3, older overlay) | NO | `server/upr_pipeline.py` (`POLISHED_VARIANT`), `tools/gen_upr_polished_ini.py` | `tests/unit/test_upr_polished_pipeline.py`, `tests/unit/test_gen_upr_polished_ini.py`; `LIVE_RESULTS.md` Run 3 Stages R1-R3 |
| Phone-card SLink contact | MODEL-TESTED, LIVE-RUN | YES: `PASS pol-phone` frame 3103 on `deebb100`, lane `g2int-ov/phone2.out` (not in a committed doc). The earlier Stage 1 run (`34942315`) is in `LIVE_RESULTS.md` | `patch/polished/src/slink.asm` (`SlinkPhone_*`); `lua/gen2/phone.lua`; commit `c9f1ad14f` | `tests/unit/test_polished_phone_entry.py`, `tests/unit/test_polished_companion.py`. "Call" on the contact now opens `SlinkPanel` (`slink.asm:179-191`); the old "CallGate prints a stub" wording is obsolete |
| phone calls (real in-game calls) | NOT STARTED: no call transport | NO | `SlinkPhone_CallGate` opens the panel and never rings | `tests/unit/test_polished_phone_entry.py` |
| panel pages | MODEL-TESTED, LIVE-RUN on `68894579` (DEV); rows truncated | YES on `68894579`: C0-C5 against a scripted mailbox host (`LIVE-PANEL-PAGES-ROM`), hello `panel=true`, `panel_abi 3` (`LIVE-PANEL-HELLO`), real-host paging server `link_panel` -> lua `panel:hold` -> ROM (`LIVE-PANEL-HOST-PAGING`). NO for readability: wide `label|field` rows are cut to the 16-glyph panel (`info_panel_width()==0` inherited), fix in flight (`pol-panelfix`) | `patch/polished/src/panel.asm`; commit `5ed073821`; spec `PANEL.md`; driver `panel_host_live.{py,lua}` (`8edc811f2`) | `tests/unit/test_polished_panel.py`; receipts `live_panel_pages_rom.json`, `live_panel_hello.json`, `live_panel_host_paging.json` (lanes `F:/slink-work/lanes/pol-rcproof/{panel,hello}`, `pol-panelhost`). Historical: `7461c828` lane PASS, `9c60bc8f` FAIL (`LIVE_PANEL.md`) |
| sounds | MODEL-TESTED, LIVE-RUN. PASS on `ac65532c` and on `deebb100` | YES: `PASS pol-sounds` frame 633, caps `$07`, four codes post to ack to play, busy-channel hold 163 frames (under 240), every host write at `$C612` | `lua/gen2/polished_sounds.lua`; commits `ef7fdd60e`, `983693620` | `tests/unit/test_polished_sounds.py`, `tests/unit/test_polished_sounds_wired.py`; `LIVE_SOUNDS.md`. Not exercised: reset-latch path, music-fade hold. The Manager `native_sounds` row was never run through a real client/server pair |
| native trade (receptionist) | IMPLEMENTED, DEV-only; C5 bounded rollback built but commit disabled, gate `7e:573B=0` | NO | `trade_commit.asm:1-21`: last/sole-slot pre-UI removal failure rollback only; first durable store is point of no return; non-last partial rotations hold result 2. Owner yes and enabled evidence still required | `LIVE_RESULTS.md:770-797`: six held-service cases PASS on `cf03f53a` with SYNTH + TEST HOST and disabled commit; cold reload PASS only for empty referenced boxes, not post-commit durability |
| trade dispatch fingerprint | MODEL-TESTED. Engine-state blocks are INFERRED, not measured | NO | `server/adapters/polished_trade_fingerprint.py` and Lua twin `lua/gen2/polished_trade_fp.lua` | `tests/unit/test_polished_trade_fp.py` (38; see its docstring on INFERRED values) |
| trade lease / mailbox binder | IMPLEMENTED, DEV-only; advertised trade stays false; cancel API landed, pump wiring queued | NO | `polished_trade.lua:393,481-512,614-641`: `cancel(reason)` closes pre-APPLY visit; arm fault is NOT_PERFORMED only after readback proves no APPLY publication and cancellation succeeds, otherwise UNCERTAIN. `client.lua` does not call cancel yet; see `TRADE_PUMP.md:101-111` | `test_polished_trade_binder.py`, `test_polished_trade_composition.py`; test presence, not re-run here. `entry.lua:958-986` retains explicit dev composition |
| calculator | **PARTIAL**: baseline works (`calculateRBYGSC` over Polished data). Crit: the Polished scaling (x1.5, x2.25 with Sniper) is implemented (`CALC.md` s4.1), `effect_commands.asm:4333-4343` (`CALC.md` section 4.1). Abilities unsupported: `supports_abilities()` is False (`gen2_polished.py:630`) | NO | `tools/gen_polished_calc.py`; commit `c32791fe` | `tests/unit/test_gen_polished_calc.py` (19) |
| overlay build + byte guard | MODEL-TESTED; integrated C5 body is built but disabled, not live-qualified | n/a (build artefact) | `tools/build_polished_companion.py`; current overlay sha1 `688945795e2656019247f5aaceb7b1d8791e900a` (`data/polished/overlay_provenance.json` `output.sha1`, UPS 4166 B; title wordmark `1d750de2e`). `SlinkTradeCommitEnabled` at `7e:573B` is 0 (`TRADE.md:1421-1429`); symbol presence is not enablement | `tests/unit/test_polished_companion.py`, `tests/unit/test_polished_release_guards.py`. A full rgbds rebuild remains a BUILD-OVERLAY verifier item; no rebuild or current-cut qualification is claimed by this update |
| ROM tables / ram doc / forms pack | MODEL-TESTED (source only) | n/a | `tools/gen_polished_*.py` | `tests/unit/test_polished_rom_tables.py` (one skip when pokecrystal is not cloned), `test_polished_ram_doc.py`, `test_polished_area_map.py` |
| player ZIP carries the composed Polished dependencies | MODEL-TESTED; package manifest source checked, no ZIP built in this update | n/a | `tools/make_release.py` `_LUA_GEN2` and the `polished_crystal` pack rows. The dev-only `polished_trade.lua` binder **is listed** (`make_release.py:175`); `polished_trade_fp.lua` is not listed. Dev composition is opt-in (`entry.lua:958-986`), not a production capability | `tests/unit/test_polished_release_manifest.py`; test presence only, not re-run here |
| Polished release verifier | IMPLEMENTED and MODEL-TESTED. Its verdict is red | n/a | `tools/verify_polished_release.py`, manifest `tests/polished_release_requirements.json`, report `RC_STATUS.md`; false-green paths closed in `6fb8ea629` | `tests/unit/test_verify_polished_release.py` (90). Known red: see the header |
| C-5 randomized duo gate | PARTIAL. The gate is real release evidence: `c5_gate_errors` (`tools/verify_gen2_release.py:2462`) requires an installed, sound packet and a PHYSICAL PASS per cell at the current digest. The installer `tools/c5_install_receipts.py` has a link-safe destination and an unpinned-file gate (`verify_gen2_release.py:2458`). **Receipts are NOT installed** (`tests/fixtures/gen2/receipts/c5/` does not exist) | NO | `tools/c5_runner.py` (needs EmuHawk, about 20 min, run at freeze) | `tests/unit/test_verify_gen2_c5.py`, `tests/unit/test_c5_install.py` |

**Note W (box_mon / force_faint).** HISTORICAL (the committed `docs/polished/LIVE_WRITES.md` was updated 2026-10-06 and now records (a), (b), (d) PASS on `6e43f8d9`, bank 1, one mon; only (c) is NOT RUN). The earlier state of that document: it said
check (a), (b) and (c) are NOT RUN (the save fixture did not load). The later driver commits
`9fd4619a5` (a) and `dfeec7555` (b) fixed the harness, and the lane result file
`F:/slink-work/lanes/pol-livew/writes/result.txt` (2026-10-05) shows (a1)-(a4b) and (b0)-(b4) all `[ok]`
on the integrated overlay `deebb100`. (The document has since been updated; this tracker still cites the
result file and does not claim more than it shows.) Check (c) did not finish.

## How to re-derive this table

```bash
git log --oneline --all -- <the feature's main source file>
git branch --contains <sha>            # which branch carries it
git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> HEAD && echo in-HEAD
python -m pytest tests/unit -k polished --collect-only -q | tail -1
python -c "import json;print(json.load(open('data/polished/overlay_provenance.json'))['output']['sha1'])"
```

## Known-stale text elsewhere in `docs/polished/`

Marked in place, not rewritten (the original wording is kept as history):

* `LIVE_WRITES.md` now records (a), (b), (d) PASS (historical, `6e43f8d9`) and (c) NOT RUN; see note W.
* `LIVE_RESULTS.md` Phone Stage 1 describes the entry text "SLink is linked." That was the Stage 1
  overlay (`34942315`); the contact now opens the panel.
* `FORMS.md`, owner rulings: said `polished_codec.key` "today keeps form 0-4 as traits". `key_form`
  normalises cosmetic forms now (`server/adapters/polished_codec.py:82-85`).
* `LIVE_RESULTS.md`, the Alolan Persian GAP: closed in code by `43ee19f0` and the effective-species wire.
* `PHONE.md`, `PHONE_SLOT.md`, `POKEGEAR_SLOT.md`, `TITLE.md`: said ROM0 has "351 bytes free at `$015f`".
  `$015f` is that **count**, not an address; the real gaps are `$0089-$00FF` and the part of `$3F34-$3FFF`
  after the phone bridge. `HOOKS.md:812-813` carries the correction.
* `CLIENT.md` line 4 quotes overlay sha1 `29ea04c2` as current. That is right for the runs it describes;
  the current overlay is in `data/polished/overlay_provenance.json`.

## Unverified in this table

* Every LIVE-RUN statement is a claim about a historic DEV run recorded in `LIVE_RESULTS.md`,
  `LIVE_SOUNDS.md` or a lane result file. None was re-run here and none is a PHYSICAL receipt. The
  lane files under `F:/slink-work/lanes/` are outside the repository.
* The count "18 failing items" is the coordinator's figure; this rewrite started the verifier and
  stopped it before it finished.
* Test counts are collected, not passed.

## Box-command gaps before `supports_box_mon()` / `supports_explode_mode()` may flip (2026-10-06; headless Codex cx-532590c0 + Polished peer cx-c0a19d75; code re-read by the coordinator where marked)

Both flags stay **False**. Live (a)(b)(d) PASS proves memory effects of one mon in pokedb bank 1 only; it does not exercise the client ack, the server reaction or partial failure.
1. **Withdraw never acked (CONFIRMED; CLOSED IN CODE/MODEL by `4bda8793d`, current-cut live qualification outstanding):** executor returns `true, <table>`, client concatenates it as the settle-note string before `sync_retrieve_done`. Fix = `O.client_boxes` adapter in `polished_overworld.lua`, wrapped in `entry.lua` (claude/pol-boxfix).
2. **Full party never retries (CONFIRMED; CLOSED with gap 1):** `party full (6/6)` vs the client's exact `party full`.
3. **Post-mutation failures are reported as ordinary refusals (OPEN design):** deposit (stage -> flag/Banks/Entries -> compaction -> count last) and withdraw (record/OT/nick -> count last -> Entries erase -> Banks clear) can all fail AFTER bytes changed; `run_box` then sends `box_mon_failed` / `sync_retrieve_failed`, and `server/state.py` 617-660 assumes the move did NOT happen (restores the party model / drops the rebuild key / re-boxes the partner). There is no `box_mon_done` event. Needs a third outcome (proved complete / proved not complete / uncertain) honoured by both ends, classified from a fresh census plus the exact party block and the permit receipts; a census key list cannot prove an intact party after compaction. No mailbox byte is proposed.
4. **Memorialize is not composed** (`polished_overworld.lua` refuses by name; NEWBOX specifies box 20 / index 19); withdraw does not exclude the memorial box.
5. **Last-healthy-mon guard:** the Polished executor guards only `party.count <= 1`, as the vanilla Gen 2 executor does (`lua/gen2/boxes.lua:460,581`); native storage also refuses to leave no healthy mon. Parity decision, not a regression.
6. **Allocation rollover and bank 2:** allocation rollover MODEL tests are integrated (`test_polished_allocation_rollover.py`: entries 167/168, 195/196, 207, bank-1-full -> bank 2, both banks full); NOT proven live: flags are retained after withdraw (native `NewStoragePointer` rebuilds them); one live bank-2 deposit/withdraw + native save/reload still owed.
7. **Egg/mail:** CLOSED IN CODE/MODEL (`647ffe59f`): withdraw refuses a boxed egg and a mail holder, deposit refusals are pinned in `test_polished_executor_refusals.py`.
8. **Retry identity:** a completed withdraw retried without its settle is now an idempotent done (WITHDRAW.md 'Idempotent withdraw'; key-level limits there); two byte-identical independent mons collapse on reconcile (documented in WITHDRAW.md).
9. **Reset durability:** the 73-cut withdraw sweep is in-memory; there is no deposit byte-cut sweep and no emulator reset/native-save scenario.
10. **Explode:** bench targets and item/switch fallbacks refuse (`polished_explode.lua:183-186`); the five-byte move replacement is tested, the forced death outcome (Damp, action prevention) is not; live battle negatives (c) NOT RUN.
11. **Evidence is for a past overlay:** the live PASS names `6e43f8d9`; the current overlay differs. Re-run on the frozen cut.

### Status of the box-command gaps (source update 2026-10-08 at `cb477bc1`)
Closed in code: gaps 1 and 2 (withdraw ack and `party full` retry, `O.client_boxes`, commit `4bda8793d`, composed at `lua/gen2/entry.lua:910-913`); gap 7 egg/mail executor guards (`647ffe59f`). Gap 3's three-outcome contract is **GO, Gen 3 first (owner 2026-10-06, relayed above)**, not waiting for an owner ruling; its Polished implementation/integration and failure qualification remain open. Rival source writer is composed at `entry.lua:917-923`, REFUSING by default; SYNTH staging is authorised with disclosure, but the rival hook at `0f:47DD`, live PC semantics and class set remain open. The plain-faint path has opt-in settlement composition at `entry.lua:924-927`; parity + plain-faint scope is DECIDED, not qualification. Gaps 4 (memorialize), 5 (last-healthy parity), 6 (live bank-2/native-reload evidence), 8-11 retain the qualifications/limits above. `supports_box_mon()` and `supports_explode_mode()` remain **False** (`server/adapters/gen2_polished.py:751-763`); approved decisions do not flip capabilities.
