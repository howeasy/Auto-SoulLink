# C5 commit and C6 responder: proposed ROM contracts

**Status update 2026-10-08:** C6 landed (overlay `57f039b6` then, including its responder fix); C5 landed (merge `7f56228b5`, overlay `877a477a`, `SlinkTradeCommitEnabled` at `7e:573B` = **0**, not enabled). See `TRADE.md:1417-1429` and `overlay_provenance.json:63`; no live qualification or commit enablement is claimed. The introduction below describes its historical design cut.

Design only. Source cut: `b082abbe69162d02617dd8e58974629ee0faac5b`; overlay v8 SHA1
`add6c9440d3485839996525052cf34d5d04963d1`. No commit, responder, production capability,
server protocol change or live run is authorized by this document. The existing proposer
publishes only NOT_PERFORMED after APPLY; the responder entry is a `ret`.
Evidence: `data/polished/overlay_provenance.json:1-27`, `patch/polished/src/trade_service.asm:186-238`,
`patch/polished/src/trade_dispatch.asm:136-143`, `docs/polished/TRADE.md:1409-1413`.

## Reading the evidence

`P/` below means the **read source** at `F:/slink-work/cache/polished/src/`, pinned to
v3.2.3 commit `3fa43192379df5c3e7b09a08e4d5d79af4f02f42` (checked with Git).
Repository paths are relative to `F:/slink-work/wt/pol-c56doc/`. All cited line ranges
refer to these cuts. **PROPOSED** means an implementation requirement, not existing
behavior; **UNVERIFIED** means source/model evidence has not established the claim.
Native routine symbols, bank/address and geometry must always come from the rebuilt sym.

**Three highest-risk questions before enabling commit:**

1. **Can every interruption recover a coherent party/mail/save image?** Polished removal
   rotates SRAM mail immediately, unlike the vanilla helper's delayed shift. Main-save,
   backup-save and mail/storage recovery phases must be exercised by cold-load cuts;
   neither a returning save routine nor a RAM comparison proves this. See §3.
2. **What exact incoming domain is authorized, especially eggs, forms, HP/stats and the
   last usable mon?** The current ROM validator deliberately does not validate moves,
   HP/status/stats or form policy. Enabling native animation/evolution broadens its consumers.
   Egg display normalization and suppression of egg evolution need explicit tests and an
   owner policy; species/level validity alone is insufficient. See §2.
3. **Does the full native call chain fit the real stack and remain non-reentrant?** The
   real stack is C000..C0FF; the existing SM83 tests default to D000 and have no interrupt
   or SRAM/WRAM banking model. Responder menus, evolution and a full save are deeper than
   the current proposer stub/service evidence. See §5.

## 1. Preserve the existing boundary

- Keep the exact 70-byte outgoing snapshot (48-byte record + 11-byte OT span + 11-byte
  nickname) in OT slot 1. Incoming data stays in scattered OT slot 0; sender name is a
  separate 11-byte span. No contiguous-pointer shortcut and no relaxed comparison mask.
  (`patch/polished/src/trade_snapshot.asm:4-20,28-93`;
  `trade_validate.asm:4-13,111-149` in the same directory.)
- Preserve v8's APPLY inspection-before-expiry: frame 3600 is eligible; frame 3601 is not.
  Keep the host's strictly-later-frame OFFER-answer/APPLY rule. Do not transplant vanilla's
  old counter-first APPLY loop. (`patch/polished/src/trade_service.asm:145-186`;
  `docs/polished/TRADE.md:1413`; `lua/gen2/polished_trade.lua:357-374`.)
- C5 exports `SlinkTradeCommit` and `SlinkTradeCommitEnd`. C6 exports
  `SlinkTradeResponderService` and `SlinkTradeResponderServiceEnd`; the fixed PromptEntry
  becomes a `jp` trampoline to that real body. The existing paired-marker profile logic
  describes component presence, not authorization; retain `production: false`.
  (`tools/gen_polished_profile.py:292-308,362-369`;
  `patch/polished/src/trade_dispatch.asm:136-143`.)
- These ROM cards alone cannot deliver a production two-player trade: the merged host
  binder refuses PROMPT, never advertises, maps unexpected DONE values to UNCERTAIN, and
  is exposed only as a dev part. A separate host integration card is a dependency, not
  an implied side effect of adding symbols. (`lua/gen2/polished_trade.lua:337-401`;
  `lua/gen2/entry.lua:950-979`.)

## 2. C5: bounded native mutation contract

### Interface and preflight (PROPOSED)

Input: A = selected outgoing **zero-based slot**, B = role 0 proposer / 1 responder.
The caller owns a held, authenticated lease, the private token/generation/count/slot,
an exact snapshot, and a current successful full-save checkpoint. It has an open speech
textbox. Never infer the role from serial-clock state; SLink uses no cable exchange.
This adapts the vanilla helper interface, not its implementation
(`patch/gen2/src/trade_commit.asm:1-42`; native serial role selection is
`P/engine/link/link.asm:1603-1609`).

Return values: **1** only for a proved pre-mutation refusal; **0** only after mutation,
native evolution/postconditions and the chosen native save have returned; **2** for any
uncertain/post-mutation failure. An unexpected return value is treated as 2 by the caller.
Zero is a *cartridge completion observation*, not an independently durable two-player receipt.
This is a proposed refinement: vanilla returns 2 even for its bad-entry branch
(`patch/gen2/src/trade_commit.asm:15-42`); current Polished has no helper call at all
(`patch/polished/src/trade_service.asm:197-203`).

Before the first **party, dex or SRAM mutation**, recheck:

1. Role, WRAM mapping, normal VBlank mode, no battle/link/paused-save/contest context,
   party count 1..6, slot within count, private count unchanged, live save identity and
   the same token/slot/generation. Lease pickup ACK and stack/private context are not a
   party mutation. The existing APPLY path already checks most transport/count conditions;
   the commit entry must not be callable with guessed globals.
   (`patch/polished/src/trade_service.asm:145-200,343-378`;
   `patch/polished/src/trade_dispatch.asm:81-130`.)
2. Call `SlinkTradeValidateIncomingStaged`, `SlinkTradeCheckOwnSlot` and exact
   `SlinkTradeValidateSnapshot` immediately before the mutation boundary, with no menu,
   delay, save prompt or host-staging window between the final checks and removal.
   Validate both outgoing and incoming names before rendering them. Native getters are
   not a substitute for validation. Existing predicates accept underlying species
   1..FE or 101..123, level 1..100, legal non-mail item, nature <25 and bounded terminated
   text; they do **not** establish full form/stat policy.
   (`patch/polished/src/trade_validate.asm:15-39,43-149`;
   `docs/polished/TRADE.md:1376-1380`.)
3. Apply the owner-approved last-usable-mon rule to **the resulting party**, not merely
   count >1. Native `CheckAnyOtherAliveMonsForTrade` searches other local HP, then incoming
   HP; it permits replacing the sole usable mon with a usable incoming mon. Preserve this
   rule unless the owner explicitly chooses another policy. Its globals are slot indices
   at this point. (`P/engine/link/link.asm:1219-1251`.)
4. Resolve the remaining form/egg/canonical-stat policy before enabling C5. Current tests
   may directly exercise defined cases, but no production caller may interpret the current
   permissive record validator as certification of arbitrary incoming records.
   (`docs/polished/TRADE.md:1379-1380`; `patch/polished/src/trade_validate.asm:24-26`.)

5. Mail policy must include the **whole local party**, not just the selected record:
   the receptionist invokes `CheckPartyForMail` before the save/wait flow
   (`P/maps/PokeCenter2F.asm:83-101`; `P/engine/link/link.asm:2820-2837`).
   Proposed default for C6 and direct C5 entry: refuse any local mail holder and any incoming
   mail before commit. Use the explicit carry/item-table predicate; do not assume the script
   wrapper's hScriptVar is a Boolean on every no-mail path without a test (the source stores
   A on the no-mail exit). `ItemIsMail_a` is compare plus complement-carry
   (`P/home/header.asm:114-122`). Permitting unselected party mail later requires an explicit
   policy relaxation and additional accepted-mail recovery evidence.

### Exact proposed sequence and native differences

| Step | Operation and postcondition | Read evidence / difference from vanilla |
|---|---|---|
| Prepare display | Before changing the outgoing slot, populate both **native 53-byte** trademon buffers: sender/OT/name fields, OT ID, **three** DV bytes, personality and full form. Set display caught-data to zero. For eggs, use display species EGG and clear EXTSPECIES_MASK in the **display form only**, retaining the egg flag; assert that the display extended species is FF, never 1FF. Never replace the underlying party species with EGG. | `P/macros/ram.asm:252-276`; `P/engine/link/link.asm:1474-1574`; `P/engine/movie/trade_animation.asm:1253-1263`; `P/engine/gfx/trademon_frontpic.asm:1-23`; risk noted in `docs/polished/TRADE.md:1379-1380`. Explicit personality initialization is required by its consumer even though the cable preparation excerpt does not fill every byte. Test the proposed egg-display normalization; do not assume the generic Lua encode helper supplies it. |
| Save controls | Preserve BC/DE/HL, role, original count/slot, and any native controls this helper changes (at least link mode, force evolution, current party/OT indices, withdraw parameter, jumptable/dialog, state flags/sprite updates; record others found by the write census). Keep the original slot separate from native variables that later become species bytes. | Native cable path overwrites `wCurTradePartyMon`/`wCurOTTradePartyMon` with species at `P/engine/link/link.asm:1576-1595`; vanilla preservation pattern `patch/gen2/src/trade_commit.asm:45-86`. Do not copy a guessed byte list without a write census. |
| Remove | Set `wCurPartyMon=outgoing slot`, `wPokemonWithdrawDepositParameter=0`; call the **Polished** `RemoveMonFromParty` predef. Require count N-1. This routes to `SetStorageBoxPointer` with B=0, C=slot+1, E=0, shifts the selected slot to the end, then decrements count. | `P/engine/pokemon/move_mon.asm:894-901`; `P/engine/pc/bills_pc.asm:539-550,585-623`. Not vanilla `RemoveMonFromPartyOrBox`. The chain swaps record, nickname, full OT span **and SRAM mail** (`bills_pc.asm:263-297`). Do not call vanilla `.ShiftMail` afterward or copy the cable routine's separate mail-exchange block. |
| Animate | Disable sprite updates; clear/load native graphics using Polished `ClearTileMap`, `LoadFontsBattleExtra`, A=`CGB_PLAIN`, `GetCGBLayout`. Select `TradeAnimation` or banked `TradeAnimationPlayer2` from the local role. No serial wait/check-byte loop. | `P/engine/link/link.asm:1597-1609`; `P/engine/movie/trade_animation.asm:1-16,57-72`. `GetSGBLayout`/SCGB conventions and a near call from another bank are wrong ports. Symbol currently places Player2 at 0A:52DE. |
| Materialize | After animation, copy incoming OT slot 0 to temp with **B=$81, C=1, HL=wOTPartyMon1Species**, `farcall CopyBetweenPartyAndTemp`; it copies record, nickname and full OT metadata. Then `farcall AddTempMonToParty`; require carry clear and count N. | `P/engine/link/link.asm:1611-1624`; `P/engine/pc/bills_pc.asm:625-670`; `P/engine/pokemon/move_mon.asm:448-512`. Copying just 48 bytes leaves stale temp names. Do not set/use a nonexistent `wOTPartySpecies` list or require host-written `wOTPartyCount=1`. |
| Append check | Newly appended slot is N-1. Compare its species **and full form**, OT 11 and nickname 11 with staged input; compare the 48-byte record with only the native non-egg happiness change allowed. Preserve caught-data, caught-level/location, level and held item here. Verify the unaffected party prefix/order in the model tests. | Append copies all 48 bytes and both name spans; for non-eggs only, it sets seen/caught and BASE_HAPPINESS (`move_mon.asm:455-509`). Egg path skips both. Nine-bit decoding is `P/home/pokemon.asm:408-416`; dex species/form dispatch is `P/home/pokedex_flags.asm:89-131`. No blanket mask and no clearing the actual party caught fields. |
| Evolve | For an owner-admitted non-egg, set `wCurPartyMon=N-1`, `wForceEvolution=EVOLVE_TRADE` (**3**, not TRUE=1), use the intended nonzero trade link mode during native evolution, then `farcall EvolvePokemon`. Check count remains N. For eggs, proposed safe rule is **skip forced evolution**, preserving the egg record; owner must explicitly approve egg support or refuse eggs before removal. | `P/constants/pokemon_data_constants.asm:312-317`; `P/engine/link/link.asm:1594-1595,1623-1626`; `P/engine/pokemon/evolve.asm:1-56,93-107,153-169`. Everstone blocks; Linking Cord rows need EVOLVE_TRADE, other trade rows require/consume the held item (`evolve.asm:298-304`). Examples: `P/data/pokemon/evos_attacks.asm:1278,1309,1505,1562,2077`. |
| Evolved check | Expect native changes to species/form, consumed item, non-custom species name, max stats/HP delta and potentially learned moves. Verify identity continuity (OT, DVs, unaffected personality/metadata), valid final record and expected native evolution path; do not compare evolved output byte-for-byte with the unevolved stage. | `P/engine/pokemon/evolve.asm:364-379,425-499`. `GetEvosAttacksPointer` does not test the egg bit; the separate `GetEvolutionData` does (`evolve.asm:807-826`, `P/home/pokemon.asm:499-505`). Egg suppression here is a deliberate proposed guard, not a claim that native EvolvePokemon guarantees it. |
| Save and restore | Use the full post-commit save contract in §3. Only after it returns successfully and the postconditions hold may the helper return 0. Restore caller controls, SRAM closure/bank contract and map speech display with `ReturnToMapWithSpeechTextbox`; leave the responder's final CloseText to its service exit. Do not return to serial/link-room machinery. | Map restoration and its own DelayFrame: `P/home/map.asm:1597-1622`; NPC control preservation: `P/engine/events/npc_trade.asm:61-72`; serial loop to omit: `P/engine/link/link.asm:1632-1666`. |

**UNVERIFIED:** the complete set of native animation/evolution scratch writes, maximum
stack depth and all legal regional/cosmetic evolution outcomes. The table defines the
sequence to test, not permission to assume those postconditions. Runtime input is frozen
for the lease; the host must not restage after pickup. Native UI potentially clobbering OT
slot 0/snapshot must be detected in the oracle, not hidden by a broad write whitelist.

## 3. Saving, uncertainty and mail/storage recovery

**Proposed baseline:** retain the receptionist's pre-trade full-save checkpoint; C6 must
obtain a user-confirmed `Link_SaveGame` before its snapshot. After successful append and
evolution, use `ForceGameSave` (no new overwrite question) for a **full native save**, not
an invented party-byte flush. This is a deliberate stronger choice than native cable
`SaveAfterLinkTrade`; approve it as part of C5's commit policy.

Read facts:

- `Link_SaveGame` calls `AskOverwriteSaveFile`, then `ForceGameSave`; Force sets pause,
  calls `SavedTheGame`, clears pause, returns carry clear. `SavedTheGame` invokes
  `SaveGameData` and writes the save version (`P/engine/menus/save.asm:52-65,148-156`).
- `SaveAfterLinkTrade` saves Pokémon data, primary/backup checksums, backup Pokémon data,
  mail backup and RTC; it is **not** the full player/options/storage path
  (`save.asm:36-50,311-330`). Dex flags lie inside wPokemonData, so do not incorrectly
  claim that it omits dex: sym `wPokemonData=DCCE`, `wPokedexCaught=DE7B`,
  `wPokedexSeen=DEAD`, `wPokemonDataEnd=DFF3` (`data/polished/polished_slink.sym:67655-68175`).
- Full save records options/player/Pokémon data, sets the save phase before making the
  main checksum valid, writes backup mail/storage/game data and clears the phase
  (`save.asm:158-213`). The full-save native storage backup is expected; arbitrary
  gameplay box insertion/allocation is not part of this party-to-party transaction.
- `SaveStorageSystem` copies active box pointers into their backup; `AddStorageMon`
  instead allocates a pokedb entry and may Crash if already occupied. Never route C5
  through a box-deposit/newbox allocation path (`save.asm:224-233`;
  `P/engine/pc/bills_pc.asm:495-532,672-703`).
- Load checks primary/backup checksums and save phase, may finish `WriteBackupSave`,
  then restores party mail and storage (`save.asm:386-429`). Mail backup/restore copies
  all six party mail entries plus mailbox data (`P/engine/pokemon/mail.asm:235-258`).

**Mutation boundary:** after RemoveMonFromParty starts, there is no safe-refusal return,
no automatic retry and no rollback promise. A count/readback/evolution/save failure is
result 2, held for recovery; do not save an already-detected partial party merely to
finish the handshake. At result 0 also retain the transaction until matching RELEASE;
there is no B or timeout escape after commit entry. Result 2 ignores RELEASE. This is
the vanilla service's distinction to port deliberately, not current Polished behavior
(`patch/gen2/src/trade_service.asm:282-352` versus Polished `trade_service.asm:206-238`).

**Proposed runtime save readback:** before returning 0, compare primary and backup saved
Pokémon-data spans (count/records/OT/nickname/dex included) with the live postimage, verify
their native checksum coverage and save phase 0, and close SRAM. Derive each range from
the copy/checksum symbols, not a guessed save-file offset (`P/engine/menus/save.asm:311-330,352-384,394-401`).
Any mismatch or unclassifiable read is result 2. The backing device's persistence remains
UNVERIFIED even after this in-process comparison; it does not replace cold loading.

**Cold-reload acceptance:** two independently staged native save copies, process stopped
without savestate recovery, cold boot, then read party/count/order, identity/form/item,
OT extras, nickname, HP/stats, dex, mail association and gameplay/backup storage census.
Cut before removal, inside rotations, after append, during evolution, and at each primary/
backup/mail/storage save phase. Outcomes may be coherent old or coherent new save according
to the native phase, never an invented universal atomicity claim. Result 0 plus cold-load
new state on both sides is required for a durable trade receipt. A model trap returning
from save cannot close this obligation. Unrelated party mail must be a refusal control
under the proposed default; an owner-enabled relaxation needs accepted-mail interruption
cuts too. Mail-array bytes still rotate even when the active party holds no mail.

## 4. C6: responder consent and held APPLY

Port the **flow** of `patch/gen2/src/trade_service.asm:135-209,210-352`, not its species-list,
save assumptions or counter-first timeout. Proposed phases:

1. Fixed `SlinkTradePromptEntry` jumps to the real responder body; preserve the dispatcher's
   DE and return depth. Recheck header, PROMPT, generation != ACK, nonzero token, live party/
   slot/domain conditions. Allocate/zero the same 10-byte stack context; copy token, own slot,
   generation/count and role=1. Publish pickup ACK=received generation **before any native UI**.
2. Before rendering incoming nickname, run bounded text/record policy checks. Own outgoing
   nickname comes from the selected local slot. OpenText, offer text, YesNoBox; NO/B declines.
   On YES, ask permission for the full save; call Link_SaveGame and treat carry/decline as
   no consent. This can save before any trade; do not describe the pre-APPLY path as SRAM-free.
3. After every menu/save returns, recheck the held token/generation/slot, count and outgoing
   legality, then capture the exact 70-byte snapshot. Publish PROMPT completion: result 0
   means **consent only**, result 1 means decline. Preserve the received generation; DONE
   publication order is result/header/token/slot/command, generation, **ACK last**.
   Reuse the Polished publisher's stack-relative contract, not copied offsets at a new depth
   (`patch/polished/src/trade_service.asm:275-320`).

   **Normalization checkpoint:** the proposer script runs `FixPlayerEVsAndStats` before
   its menu (`P/maps/PokeCenter2F.asm:83`). C6 lacks that script. Proposed parity: after the
   user's save consent, but before the full save and snapshot, perform that normalization,
   preserving/revalidating the selected slot. It can change EVs, stats and current HP, so
   this pre-save branch is not party-byte-read-only and must have its own whitelist.
   Never normalize after the snapshot. The native routine loops all party slots through
   `UpdatePkmnStats`; EV adjustment depends on the modern-EV option, and HP is adjusted
   for stat changes (`P/engine/pokemon/move_mon.asm:953-1023`;
   `P/engine/pokemon/mon_stats.asm:545-561`). If the later native overwrite dialog is
   declined, report no trade, not “no bytes changed.”
4. Decline: bounded 90-frame RELEASE wait, with B/timeout allowed, then close lease and
   CloseText. Consent: keep the foreground stack, textbox, token and snapshot while waiting
   for matching RELEASE of the PROMPT generation; only after observing it accept fresh APPLY
   generation=previous+1 (including FF->00), ACK=previous, same token and own slot.
   RELEASE-before-APPLY is another observable boundary: host must not overwrite RELEASE with
   APPLY in the same unobserved frame. Before commit, B/timeout may cancel; use v8's inclusive
   3600-frame APPLY boundary and specify whether the consent RELEASE wait shares that budget
   (proposal: bounded total wait, like the vanilla flags path).
5. Fresh APPLY pickup ACK precedes the staged-input/count/snapshot checks. In a commit-disabled
   build, finish with result 1 just like the proposer. In an explicitly enabled commit build,
   call C5 once; map 0/1/2 by the mutation contract, retain no-escape holds for 0/2, and never
   redispatch a repeated generation. Exit closes the responder-owned text exactly once;
   there is no receptionist script to execute `endtext`. The proposer still returns to the
   timeout gate's redirect (`patch/polished/src/trade_gate.asm:37-50`).

Shared waits/exit must be reached with the original context-base SP (tail `jp`, not an
extra `call` frame). The publisher's own return address already accounts for its +2
offsets. An extra push across a shared wait silently retargets token/count/result/flags;
test the stack image at each transition, not only the final balanced SP.
(`patch/polished/src/trade_service.asm:234-248,275-320`.)

**Re-entry:** dispatcher guards include the nine-byte return-chain fingerprint, bank mapping,
script/battle/link/pause/menu/VBlank/map/step/event state and fresh PROMPT generation
(`patch/polished/src/trade_dispatch.asm:50-130`). Native menu/save/nested service DelayFrames
are not the original idle chain; pickup also makes gen==ACK. Keep both protections. Do not
set wLinkMode merely to fake admission or rely only on hInMenu. The bridge's plain dispatcher
call must stay at the same depth (`patch/polished/src/slink.asm:113-119`). A forged fresh
PROMPT during the held service must still fail its stack/engine guards.

**Host compatibility:** C3's `advertised=false`, proposer-only arm and DONE=1-only release
remain correct for the current build (`lua/gen2/polished_trade.lua:337-401`). Introduce a
separately gated, role/phase-aware host path: PROMPT/DONE0 => CONSENT (not COMPLETE),
APPLY/DONE1 => NOT_PERFORMED, APPLY/DONE2 or unknown => UNCERTAIN; APPLY/DONE0 => a new
completion disposition only with the enabled-commit provenance and independently observed
postconditions. Preserve all old negative tests on the commit-disabled cut. Do not blindly
change `result == 1` to accept 0 or infer enablement from helper symbol presence. Server
event/recovery semantics need their own reviewed host card; C4 intentionally supplies no
client pump (`lua/gen2/entry.lua:950-979`; `lua/gen2/client.lua:691-695,1508-1518,1904-1907`).

## 5. Space, stack and verification budget

The v8 map has dispatcher 4700..4779, PromptEntry 4780, proposer 4A00..4CEF, then free
4CF0..7FFF in bank 7E (`data/polished/polished_slink.map:3865-3889`). Reserve proposer
growth below its existing 5000 limit; place new C5/C6 bodies at/above 5000 with linker
ASSERTs and measured End symbols. These are proposed placement constraints, not permanent
literal addresses. Extend the builder's allowed extent and required-symbol census: it
currently stops at DispatchEnd/ProposerServiceEnd (`tools/build_polished_companion.py:219-234`).

No new WRAM/mailbox scratch: 69 mailbox bytes are already reserved, and OT slot 1 holds
the snapshot. Private service context remains 10 bytes. Bridge push AF/BC/HL plus saved-bank
AF is **8 bytes**, despite the stale four-byte comment (`patch/polished/src/slink.asm:47-64`).
The dispatcher adds its return/preserved-DE/call frames; a jump trampoline adds no new
return. Budget C5 locals explicitly (vanilla saves 6 register bytes +10 control bytes +2
role/count bytes, before native call depth), then measure the Polished-specific additions.
(`patch/gen2/src/trade_commit.asm:17-86`; `patch/polished/src/trade_dispatch.asm:125-130`.)

Proposed C5 explicit-local ceiling: **24 bytes**, excluding its return/native call frames:
6 saved-register bytes, 10 native-control bytes, 2 role/count, 2 private slot/alignment,
2 saved SVBK/VBlank, 2 reserve. This is a design budget, not measured safety. Restore
SVBK/VBlank to the qualified entry values and the caller's ROM bank; close SRAM. Any
larger layout requires a reviewed budget change rather than borrowing mailbox bytes.

Real stack endpoints are C000/C0FF (`data/polished/polished_slink.sym:63638-63640`). Run the
SM83 calls with an explicit realistic SP as well as sentinel-depth checks; its default
D000 is not stack-headroom evidence. Interrupt and SRAM/WRAM banking behavior are absent
from the model (`tests/unit/polished_sm83.py:13-23,39,738`). **UNVERIFIED** maximum native
UI/save/evolution depth and ISR margin: live high-water measurement on both roles is a
hard enablement prerequisite, especially during nested DelayFrame calls.

## 6. Cards, ownership and acceptance

Each row is a proposed exclusive lease of at most three files; no worker may overlap the
service, builder or generated-output owner. Test file names below are proposals, not existing
evidence. C5/C6 authoring may run in parallel only for their separate new asm/test pairs.

| Order/card | Exclusive files (repository-relative) | Acceptance / first falsifier |
|---|---|---|
| C5-A: helper, unwired | `patch/polished/src/trade_commit.asm`; `tests/unit/test_polished_trade_commit.py` | `python -m pytest -q tests/unit/test_polished_trade_commit.py` once linked; wrong count or temp-name source must fail before a success result. Export real start/End markers; no enabled call site. |
| C6-A: responder, commit-disabled | `patch/polished/src/trade_responder.asm`; `tests/unit/test_polished_trade_responder.py` | `python -m pytest -q tests/unit/test_polished_trade_responder.py` once linked; repeated PROMPT must open one menu only; consent may not append or publish APPLY success. |

C5-A/C6-A can report **source-ready**, but their MODEL acceptance is pending until I1
produces the actual linked cut. A present stale ROM missing the new symbols must fail,
not skip or satisfy a fabricated routine trap. Keep the integration cut unqualified
until all three suites execute its rebuilt bytes.

Generated artifacts are **not silently outside these leases**. After each ROM source cut,
the coordinator freezes it and assigns serial regeneration batches of at most three files:
UPS/sym/map; overlay provenance/beacon/profile; engine sites/checkpoint and their pins;
then remaining verifier/probe SHA pins found by an exact old-SHA census. Re-run generators'
`--check` and the existing companion/profile/service tests. The builder writes more than
three outputs, so its live invocation requires an explicitly enumerated build-output lease;
the I1 source author cannot run it under a source-only three-file lease. Current provenance
enumerates the input/source hashes (`tools/build_polished_companion.py:395-420`), and profile
generation derives the present trade facts (`tools/gen_polished_profile.py:248-371`).

### SM83 oracle requirements

- Execute rebuilt helper/service bytes, not a Python replacement of their branch decisions.
  Trap native UI/animation/save only when necessary, and label the trapped claim MODEL.
  Exercise real removal/temp-copy/append and evolution subroutines where the machine permits;
  banking-dependent mail/save paths require a banking-capable harness or explicit OPEN/skip.
  Existing service rig already distinguishes native traps and CPU/host writes
  (`tests/unit/test_polished_trade_service.py:1-18`; `tests/unit/polished_sm83.py:13-23`).
- Per-branch write whitelist: early refusal = stack/lease plus declared UI/snapshot only;
  consent normalization = exactly the native EV/stat/HP changes; pre-save consent = native
  save domains, no party replacement; commit = controlled party/name/dex,
  native mail rotation, animation/temp/evolution scratch and the separately enumerated native
  save domains. Never whitelist all SRAM/WRAM to make a failing test pass. Distinguish native
  full-save storage backup writes from forbidden box-entry insertion/allocation.
- Test first/middle/last slots and counts 1/6; incoming/outgoing mail refusal; unrelated mail
  alignment; three DVs, extended and regional forms; OT metadata; nicknamed/unnicknamed;
  legal eggs only under the chosen policy; Everstone, Linking Cord and held-item evolution;
  final count/order/dex/item/name/HP changes and all 70 snapshot-byte flips.
- Fault/mutant matrix: count decrement/append failure; stale temp OT/nick; dropped form/DV;
  TRUE instead of EVOLVE_TRADE; double mail shift; ignored snapshot/token/slot; missing full
  save; result0 before save; B/timeout/RELEASE escaping result2; unconsumed consent RELEASE;
  fresh PROMPT during every nested native wait; stack push/pop imbalance. A wrong-state trap
  must not return a manufactured success. Preserve v8 final-frame and host frame-gap controls.

### Live progression and owner gates

1. Freeze the rebuilt overlay. Serverless, one-instance native proposer and responder
   prompts first: reject/decline/save-decline/timeouts, both real UI return paths, caller
   SP/bank and hVBlank/link/pause restoration, no duplicate pickup. Then explicitly authorized
   commit-enabled dev probes on private saves: animation, append, evolution and save. A
   lease response alone is not proof of any native mutation or durability.
2. Two distinct trainer identities and independently provisioned saves, real host/server,
   hello+census before a trade. Record the same token/roles, each local frozen preimage,
   consent RELEASE consumption, both APPLY pickups, native return/save and resulting
   identities. One-sided completion/disconnect stays UNCERTAIN; no blind resend of a
   committed request. The C4 dev-only graph is not yet this harness/pump.
3. Cold reload both sides and the interruption matrix in §3, including unrelated mail and
   nonempty boxes. Keep failed/partial receipts and exact ROM/source/fixture hashes. Do not
   upgrade previous stub/v6 dispatcher evidence to this changed call chain
   (`docs/polished/TRADE.md:1383-1385,1413`).

Owner decisions: enablement of any commit-capable build/live mutation; egg/form/last-usable
mon policy and full post-save choice; the phase-aware host recovery/completion contract;
production capability/hello admission and final landing. Shared server/protocol edits, if
required by H1's follow-on pump/recovery work, get their own owner GO and Gen-3-first then
other-generation regression pass (`docs/polished/BOX_WRITE_CONTRACT.md:68-69`). No push,
master merge or release claim follows from
these source/model cards. The three questions at the top remain OPEN until their named
source/model/live/cold-load evidence and owner decisions are recorded.

## Native-source fact check (2026-10-07, headless Codex magi-89038145; coordinator spot-checked #1 and #5)
Source: pinned Polished tree 3fa43192. 43 claim groups: 39 verified, 2 misleading, 2 unverifiable, 0 false. Corrections and additions the C5 card MUST absorb:
1. **"Usable" is not "nonzero HP".** `CheckAnyOtherAliveMonsForTrade` (`engine/link/link.asm:1219-1251`) only ORs the HP words of the other local slots and the incoming OT slot: no egg, species or stat validation. An incoming egg with forged HP satisfies it. The incoming-domain policy (eggs, stats, forms) stays an OPEN owner/validator gate.
2. **Save verification boundary.** The Pokemon-data checksums do not cover options, save phase, mail or box metadata (`ram/sram.asm:15-34,44-61`; `engine/menus/save.asm:320-330,374-384`). A valid-primary load ALWAYS rewrites the backup (`WriteBackupSave`) and the backup fallback calls `SaveGameData` (`ram/sram.asm:86-111,138-147`; `save.asm:403-429`): the interruption matrix must include those recovery writes. Readback of the Pokemon span proves nothing about mail/storage integrity.
3. **Evolution write set** also includes learned-move PP, evolved dex flags and dex-cache invalidation (`wDexCacheValid`), and can open the move-replacement UI (`engine/pokemon/evolve.asm:489-499,575-636,642-695`; `learn.asm:14-37,75-100`; `home/pokedex_flags.asm:89-131`).
4. **Full-save scope** also writes current-map data, clears `sBattleTowerChallengeState`, sets validity markers/version, stages RTC and temporarily changes `hVBlank` (`save.asm:148-213,275-308,332-363`). The storage backup copies box entries, bank flags, names and themes, NOT a second copy of the Pokemon database records (`save.asm:224-234`; `ram/sram.asm:138-157`).
5. **Restore map music.** Trade animation starts evolution music; evolution stops it and its link-mode return skips `RestartMapMusic`; `ReturnToMapWithSpeechTextbox` does not restart it; the native NPC trade calls `RestartMapMusic` explicitly (`engine/events/npc_trade.asm:47-54`; `trade_animation.asm:130-144`; `evolve.asm:58-71,440-443`; `home/map.asm:1597-1622`). C5's exit must restore it.
6. **NPC trading is a different construction path** (`DoNPCTrade` before the animation, `TryAddMonToParty`, caught-data, stat/HP recompute, no `AddTempMonToParty`, no trade evolution, no save): never transplant its steps into a staged-record exchange (`npc_trade.asm:41-72,153-263`).
7. Selecting the LAST party slot performs zero mail swaps in removal (`bills_pc.asm:617-619`); the removal's SRAM mail rotation already exists, so C5 must not add a second shift/exchange (`bills_pc.asm:263-297,615-623`).
8. `0A:52DE` (Player2) holds only for the current symbol file; re-derive from the rebuilt candidate's sym.
