# Polished Crystal 3.2.3 — porting SLink's Start-menu panel

**Historical design investigation, since implemented (correction 2026-10-06).** It was written as a
design card ("Nothing here is implemented"); the panel now exists in `patch/polished/src/panel.asm`,
opened by the Phone contact bridge `SlinkPhone_CallGate` in `patch/polished/src/slink.asm`. Implementation
does not establish live qualification: see `LIVE_PANEL.md` for the DEV runs and `RC_TRACKER.md` for the
current level. Where the body below disagrees with the source (notably the ROM script, see "Current ROM
rendering and input wait"), the source wins. The body maps SLink's in-game START-MENU panel (the "SLINK"
entry that opens a partner/link status panel the host paints) from vanilla pokecrystal/GSC onto
Polished Crystal v3.2.3.

Sources: `patch/gen2/src/panel.asm`, `panel_start.asm`, `panel_flags.asm`,
`lua/gen2/panel.lua`, `patch/gb/slink_abi.inc`, `docs/polished/HOOKS.md` §2 rows 6/7/9 and §3.3,
and the pinned Polished source at `F:/slink-work/cache/polished/src` plus the release ROM at
`F:/slink-work/cache/polished/release/polishedcrystal-3.2.3.gbc`.

**Method, stated up front because this lane has already been burned twice.** ROM facts below are
`bank:addr` + `flat` + bytes **read by Python from the release ROM**. `flat = bank * 0x4000 + addr -
0x4000` for `bank != 0`, and `flat = addr` for bank `00`. **WRAM is not in the ROM**: a symbol whose
address is `$C000`-`$DFFF` or `$FF80`-`$FFFF` has **no ROM bytes**, and none is quoted for it. I hit
exactly that error earlier in this lane (a ROM read at a WRAM address) and re-checked every cell.
Second guard: **all Lua tables here are 1-based**; `bytes[9]` means offset 9.

## 1. The vanilla panel flow, step by step

### Step 0 — the menu entry (`patch/gen2/src/panel_start.asm`)

Included at the **end** of native `engine/menus/start_menu.asm`, still in bank 4:

```
SlinkStartMenuEntry:
	call FadeToMenu
	farcall SlinkPanel
	ld a, 6 ; StartMenu.ReturnRedraw owns the matching window/palette restoration.
	ret
SlinkMenuString:
	db "SLINK@"
SlinkMenuDesc:
	db "Partner"
	next "status@"
ASSERT BANK(SlinkStartMenuEntry) == 4
```

The three `ASSERT BANK(...) == 4` lines are the design's own guard: the entry must link in the Start
menu's own bank because the menu's item table is a bank-relative `dw` chain.

### Step 1 — entering the panel (`patch/gen2/src/panel.asm`)

`SlinkPanel` sets `hInMenu = TRUE` and **clears all three panel mailbox bytes to `SLINK_PANEL_CLOSED
(0)`** — state, page, pages. Then, because `FadeToMenu` has hidden the map, it establishes the text
palette's original colours with `ld b, SCGB_DIPLOMA / call GetSGBLayout`, **before** revealing
anything.

### Step 2 — the page loop

```
.page:
	call ClearBGPalettes      ; waits 4 frames
	call ClearTilemap
	ld hl, wAttrmap / ld bc, SCREEN_AREA / xor a / call ByteFill   ; zero the attribute map
	hlcoord 2, 2 / ld de, .title   / call PlaceString   ; "SOUL LINK"
	hlcoord 2, 4 / ld de, .fallback / call PlaceString ; "NO CLIENT"
	xor a / ldh [hBGMapMode], a
	ld a, SLINK_PANEL_AWAIT / ld [wSlinkMailbox + SLINK_OFS_PANEL_STATE], a
	call .WaitForStage
```

**The host paints into the tilemap and attribute map directly, while everything stays hidden.**
`SLINK_PANEL_AWAIT (1)` is published only after the ROM has drawn its fallback; the client sees
AWAIT and writes tiles. `.WaitForStage` polls `SLINK_PANEL_STAGED (2)` for **90 frames**, and on
timeout **closes the write lease before revealing** — "a late client cannot paint after this screen
has become visible".

### Step 3 — revealing and the joypad

```
.ready:
	call WaitBGMap2          ; native transfer: CGB attributes first, then the tilemap
	call SetDefaultBGPAndOBP
	call .WaitForButton
	ld c, a                 ; captured AFTER JoyTextDelay; it may change working registers
	and PAD_B | PAD_START
	jr nz, .close
	... PANEL_PAGE / PANEL_PAGES paging; A on the last page closes, no wrap ...
```

`.WaitForButton` consumes the opening A/held key before accepting a new edge (`hJoyDown` → release,
`hJoyPressed` → accept). Paging is host-driven: the ROM reads `PANEL_PAGE` and `PANEL_PAGES` and
decides whether to loop.

### Step 4 — exit

`.close` zeroes state/page/pages, restores `hInMenu` from the stack, and returns `6` to
`StartMenu.ReturnRedraw`, which owns the window/tileset/palette/sprite restoration.

### The mailbox contract (`patch/gb/slink_abi.inc`)

| offset | field | role |
|---|---|---|
| `+8` | `SLINK_OFS_CAPS` | capability bits; `SLINK_CAP_PANEL EQU 1 << 1` |
| `+9` | `SLINK_OFS_PANEL_STATE` | `CLOSED 0` / `AWAIT 1` / `STAGED 2` |
| `+10` | `SLINK_OFS_PANEL_PAGE` | current page |
| `+11` | `SLINK_OFS_PANEL_PAGES` | page count |

All three panel bytes are **inside the 14-byte `SLINK_CORE_SIZE`** — the panel needs **zero**
extension bytes. (The phone extension is different: `SLINK_OFS_PHONE_REQUEST EQU 32`,
`SLINK_OFS_PHONE_ARMED EQU 33`, well past the core.)

**The critical property:** the panel is a *lease on a graphics buffer*, not a message channel. ROM
publishes `AWAIT`, the host writes `wTileMap`/`wAttrmap`, ROM publishes `STAGED`, then the transfer
happens. Nothing in the mailbox carries pixels.

---

## 2. Polished, step by step

### 2.1 The Start menu item table — **CHANGED shape**

`engine/menus/start_menu.asm:163-171`:

```
.Items:
	dw StartMenu_Pokedex,  .PokedexString
	dw StartMenu_Pokemon,  .PartyString
	dw StartMenu_Pack,     .PackString
	dw StartMenu_Status,   .StatusString
	dw StartMenu_Save,     .SaveString
	dw StartMenu_Option,   .OptionString
	dw StartMenu_Exit,     .ExitString
	dw StartMenu_Pokegear, .PokegearString
	dw StartMenu_Quit,     .QuitString
```

**Nine items, `dw handler, dw string` pairs — no description column.** Vanilla's row is
`dw StartMenu_Quit, .QuitString, .QuitDesc`; Polished dropped the third field.

Consequences for the port:

* The edit becomes `dw SlinkStartMenuEntry, SlinkMenuString` — **two** words, not three.
* **`SlinkMenuDesc` has no consumer.** `panel_start.asm`'s `db "Partner" / next "status@"` is dead
  text on Polished. It should be dropped from the port rather than carried, or the bank-4 budget is
  spent on bytes nothing reads.
* The const declaration edit still matches verbatim: `engine/menus/start_menu.asm:11`
  `const STARTMENUITEM_QUIT ; 8`, so `const STARTMENUITEM_SLINK ; 9` still applies.
* Bank 4 still holds: `StartMenu 04:6059`, `StartMenu_Quit 04:6267` — so all three
  `ASSERT BANK(...) == 4` lines still hold.

### 2.2 Does a tenth item fit? — **YES, and the reason is not the `menu_coords` literal**

`home/menu.asm:454` `AutomaticGetMenuBottomCoord`:

```
AutomaticGetMenuBottomCoord::
	ld a, [wMenuBorderLeftCoord]  / ld c, a
	ld a, [wMenuBorderRightCoord] / sub c / ld c, a
	ld a, [wMenuDataItems]        / add a / inc a      ; <-- bottom grows with the ITEM COUNT
	ld b, a
	ld a, [wMenuBorderTopCoord]   / add b
	ld [wMenuBorderBottomCoord], a
```

**The bottom edge is computed as `top + item_count + 1` — the `menu_coords` literal's `y2` is not the
bottom.** The Start menu declares `menu_coords 10, 0, 19, 17` (`:145`) and `menu_coords 10, 2, 19, 17`
(`:151`), so `y2 = 17` is slack, not the rendered bottom.

Adding a tenth item moves the bottom down exactly **one row** (e.g. `0 + 9 + 1 = 10` becomes
`0 + 10 + 1 = 11`), well inside `17`. **The item fits with no box edit and no scrollbar change.**
This is the same point that retired an earlier menu-box claim in this lane, and the code above is the
proof.

**UNVERIFIED:** Polished's per-item *visibility* rules (whether Pokedex/Pokegear rows hide
conditionally and therefore change `wMenuDataItems` at runtime). The static table is 9 rows; the
effective count in a given state was not traced.

### 2.3 The graphics path — **three of five calls are renamed or absent**

| vanilla call | vanilla | Polished | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GetSGBLayout` | `00:3340` | **ABSENT** | Polished has `GetCGBLayout` `00:004c` and `GetMemCGBLayout` `00:004b` |
| `WaitBGMap2` | `00:3200` | **ABSENT** | no counterpart by that name |
| `ClearTilemap` | `00:0fc8` | **ABSENT by that spelling**; `ClearTileMap` `00:0de0` | **renamed** |
| `ClearBGPalettes` | `00:31f3` | `ClearPalettes` `00:2cdd` | **renamed** |
| `SetDefaultBGPAndOBP` | — | `00:2ea4` | **same** |
| `FadeToMenu` | `00:2b29` | `00:280b` | **same** |
| `PlaceString` / `ByteFill` | `00:1078` / `00:3041` | `00:0030` / `00:0028` | **same** |
| `DelayFrame` / `JoyTextDelay` | `00:045a` / `00:0a57` | `00:0da8` / `00:07c3` | **same** |
| `hInMenu` | `00:ffaa` | `00:ff9a` | **same** |
| `hJoyDown` / `hJoyPressed` | `00:ffa8` / `00:ffa7` | `00:ff98` / `00:ff97` | **same** |
| `hBGMapMode` | `00:ffd4` | `00:ffbe` | **same** |
| `wAttrmap` | `00:cdd9` | `00:c308` (with `wTilemap` `$C1A0`) | **moved** |

ROM bytes, read from the release ROM (all ROM0 code, none in WRAM):

```
GetCGBLayout            00:004c  flat 0x00004c  d7 8c c6 02 d9 f1 c1 d1 e1 c9 52 ff
ReloadTilesetAndPalettes 00:24b3 flat 0x0024b3  cd 5c 04 cd 9f 2a d7 3b 41 05 cd 1f
SetDefaultBGPAndOBP     00:2ea4  flat 0x002ea4  d5 3e e4 cd 17 0a 11 e4 e4 cd 3c 0a
ClearPalettes           00:2cdd  flat 0x002cdd  f0 70 f5 3e 05 e0 70 21 80 dd 01 80
ClearTileMap            00:0de0  flat 0x000de0
```

**`ReloadTilesetAndPalettes` is the Polished counterpart of the vanilla reveal step**, and Polished's
own Start menu already uses it — `engine/menus/start_menu.asm:136 call ReloadTilesetAndPalettes`, and
`home/map.asm:1624` defines it. That is the strongest available precedent for the reveal sequence,
and it is the one call in this table that comes with a native in-menu caller rather than a
guess.

**`wAttrmap` moved to `$C308`.** The `SCREEN_AREA` `ByteFill` still works — it is an area, not an
address — but any hardcoded `$C000`-relative constant in `panel.asm` must be re-derived.

**UNVERIFIED — and this is the port's central open question:** vanilla's `WaitBGMap2` is a
*per-VBlank attribute-then-tilemap transfer with a mode handshake through `hBGMapMode`*. Polished's
`ReloadTilesetAndPalettes` is a whole-tileset reload, which is a **different operation**. Whether it
can replace `WaitBGMap2` without re-uploading tiles the host just painted, or whether the port needs
a different transfer primitive, **cannot be settled from source** — it depends on what Polished's
sprite/BG update path does with `hBGMapMode` when a menu owns the screen. Same for which of
`GetCGBLayout` / `GetMemCGBLayout` replaces `GetSGBLayout`; the semantics differ (CGB vs SGB
super-mode layout) and neither is obviously right.

## 3. Text-engine constraints for a host-supplied panel body

**First, the panel body is not text.** The vanilla panel prints exactly two strings — `.title`
`"SOUL LINK@"` at `hlcoord 2, 2` and `.fallback` `"NO CLIENT@"` at `hlcoord 2, 4` — and everything else
on screen is **host-written tiles and attributes** into `wTileMap`/`wAttrmap` while hidden. The
host-side drawing lives in `lua/gen2/panel.lua` (198 lines) against the shared `lua/gb_panel.lua`
handshake.

So the text constraints bind only the ROM's own two strings and any host staging that goes through
`PlaceString`-style paths:

| constraint | value | evidence / status |
|---|---|---|
| charmap | the game's own; `PlaceString` at `00:0030` maps it | **same** in Polished |
| left margin | the panel draws at column **2** | `hlcoord 2, 2` / `hlcoord 2, 4` in `panel.asm` |
| screen width | `SCREEN_WIDTH` is referenced across the tree (e.g. `audio/music_player.asm:156`) but **I could not read its definition** in the pinned tree | **UNVERIFIED** |
| variable-width font | Polished keeps pret's proportional font; `STRLEN`/font-width constants are referenced but **their definitions were not located** | **UNVERIFIED** |
| `SCREEN_AREA` `ByteFill` | still valid after the `wAttrmap` move to `$C308` — it is an area, not an address | proven by HOOKS §3.3 |

**The practical constraint for the port is the visible rows, not the width.** The panel owns roughly
`hlcoord 2, 2` through the bottom of the screen, and the Start menu's own box is
`menu_coords 10, 0, 19, 17` / `10, 2, 19, 17` — so the host's painted body must stay inside the
rows the panel clears and must not collide with the menu box when `StartMenu.ReturnRedraw`
restores. **UNVERIFIED:** how many text rows fit once the font metrics are read.

**Do not port `SlinkMenuDesc`.** Polished has no description column, so the string has no consumer.

## 4. The overlay edit list

Bank `$7E` is the service bank for everything except `panel_start.asm`, which must stay in bank 4.

| # | edit | vanilla | Polished | design |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **E1** | declare the item constant | `_start_menu_text()` edit 1: insert `const STARTMENUITEM_SLINK ; 9` after `const STARTMENUITEM_QUIT ; 8` | `engine/menus/start_menu.asm:11` is an **exact text match** | **UNCHANGED** — copy the edit verbatim |
| **E2** | add the item row | `	dw StartMenu_Quit,     .QuitString,     .QuitDesc
` (three words) | `engine/menus/start_menu.asm:171` is `	dw StartMenu_Quit,     .QuitString` (**two** words) | **CHANGED** — emit `dw SlinkStartMenuEntry, SlinkMenuString`; drop the description column |
| **E3** | place the code in bank 4 | append `
INCLUDE "engine/slink/panel_start.asm"
` to `start_menu.asm` | `engine/menus/start_menu.asm` is `INCLUDE`d by `main.asm:80` inside `SECTION "bank4", ROMX` (`layout.link:47`) | **UNCHANGED**, provided the append still lands inside bank 4 — appending to the end of the included file does |
| **E4** | `verify_symbol_scope(..., panel=True)` | panel grows bank 4 only | `StartMenu 04:6059`, `StartMenu_Quit 04:6267` | **UNCHANGED** — the carve-out still holds |
| **E5** | `SlinkMenuDesc` + `next "status@"` | live, feeds the description column | **no consumer** | **DELETE** from the port |
| **E6** | `ld b, SCGB_DIPLOMA / call GetSGBLayout` | SGB super-mode layout | **UNVERIFIED** replacement: `GetCGBLayout 00:004c` or `GetMemCGBLayout 00:004b` | **NEW DESIGN** |
| **E7** | `call WaitBGMap2` | attribute-then-tilemap transfer with `hBGMapMode` handshake | **UNVERIFIED** — `ReloadTilesetAndPalettes 00:24b3` is a different operation (whole tileset) | **NEW DESIGN — the central risk** |
| **E8** | `call ClearTilemap` | `00:0fc8` | `ClearTileMap` `00:0de0` | **rename** |
| **E9** | `call ClearBGPalettes` | `00:31f3` | `ClearPalettes` `00:2cdd` | **rename** |
| **E10** | `wAttrmap` | `00:cdd9` | `00:c308` | **moved** — any hardcoded constant must be re-derived |
| **E11** | `hInMenu`, `hJoyDown`, `hJoyPressed`, `hBGMapMode`, `FadeToMenu`, `PlaceString`, `ByteFill`, `SetDefaultBGPAndOBP`, `DelayFrame`, `JoyTextDelay` | vanilla addresses | Polished addresses in §2.3 | **rename/re-point only** |
| **E12** | service code | `SECTION "SLink Panel", ROMX, BANK[SLINK_SERVICE_BANK]` | move wholesale to `$7E` | **same** |
| **E13** | mailbox bytes | panel uses core `+8`/`+9`/`+10`/`+11`, `SLINK_CAP_PANEL EQU 1 << 1` | **identical** | **NO ABI CHANGE** — the panel needs zero extension bytes, unlike the phone |
| **E14** | `.WaitForStage` 90-frame timeout; `.WaitForButton` release/press | as written | unchanged logic, re-pointed calls | **same**, re-measure the frame budget on Polished's timing |

**Space budget:** the panel body lives in bank `$7E` alongside the other services (HOOKS §4 moves the
whole `Slink …` family there), so the added cost of `panel.asm` is whatever it is minus the deleted
`SlinkMenuDesc`. **UNVERIFIED:** the free bytes remaining in `$7E` after every service lands there.

## 5. What can be proven statically, and what cannot

**Provable statically (no cartridge):**
- the item table shape and therefore E1/E2/E5 — from `engine/menus/start_menu.asm:163-171`;
- that the tenth item fits — from `home/menu.asm:454` `AutomaticGetMenuBottomCoord`, whose bottom is
  `top + items + 1`;
- every symbol address above, from `data/polished/polishedcrystal.sym`;
- every ROM byte quoted, from the release ROM;
- that the three `ASSERT BANK(...) == 4` still hold — `StartMenu 04:6059`;
- that the panel needs no ABI growth — `SLINK_OFS_PANEL_STATE/PAGE/PAGES` are `+9/+10/+11`, inside
  the 14-byte core.

**Live-only (no static method):**
1. **Whether `ReloadTilesetAndPalettes` can replace `WaitBGMap2`** without destroying host-painted
   tiles. This is the port's central unknown. It is a property of the linked BG-update path.
2. **Which of `GetCGBLayout` / `GetMemCGBLayout` replaces `GetSGBLayout`.** The semantics differ
   (CGB layout vs SGB super-mode); neither is obviously right.
3. **How many text rows fit**, and the real font metrics (I could not locate `SCREEN_WIDTH`'s or
   `STRLEN`'s definition in the pinned tree).
4. **Polished's runtime item-visibility rules**, i.e. the value of `wMenuDataItems` in a given state —
   the static table is 9 rows.
5. **The 90-frame `.WaitForStage` budget** on Polished's timing, and whether 60 frames is enough for a
   host round trip at 1×.

The exact observation that settles (1): paint a distinctive pattern into `wTileMap`, call
`ReloadTilesetAndPalettes`, and read the tilemap back — if the pattern survives the transfer the
replacement is sound; if the tileset reload overwrites it, a `WaitBGMap2` equivalent must be written.

## 6. Risks

1. **E7 is the blocker.** A wrong replacement either destroys the host's pixels or shows a stale
   screen, and neither fails at link time.
2. **E6 has no obviously-correct answer**, and getting it wrong means the palette is wrong on entry
   — cosmetic but immediately visible.
3. **E5 is a silent waste.** Carrying `SlinkMenuDesc` into a table with no description column spends
   bank-4 bytes on nothing and looks like a bug to the next reader.
4. **E2 changes the anchor text.** A `verify-then-replace` builder keyed on vanilla's three-word row
   will fail to match and must be re-keyed — the failure mode is a clean "anchor not found", not a
   silent mis-patch, provided the verifier is kept.
5. **The panel is a write lease on a graphics buffer with a timeout.** Every design decision that
   lengthens the host round trip (E14) erodes the 90-frame window; the timeout already closes the
   lease before revealing so a late paint cannot corrupt a visible screen.

## 7. Ordered cards, with the first falsifier for each

| # | card | first falsifier (what would kill it) |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | settle the reveal primitive (E7) | paint a pattern into `wTileMap`, call `ReloadTilesetAndPalettes`, read the tilemap back; if the pattern is gone, E7 needs a written `WaitBGMap2` equivalent and P1 stops being a rename |
| **P2** | settle the layout call (E6) | link both candidates and compare the resulting palettes on a CGB and a DMG boot; if neither matches vanilla's, the SGB path needs a Polished-native equivalent |
| **P3** | bank-4 row: re-key the anchor to the two-word form (E2), drop `SlinkMenuDesc` (E5) | assemble `panel_start.asm`; the three `ASSERT BANK(...) == 4` failing means the append escaped bank 4 |
| **P4** | rename/re-point the call set (E8, E9, E10, E11) | assemble `panel.asm` for Polished; an unresolved symbol or a wrong `wAttrmap` constant fails the build |
| **P5** | mailbox + caps (E13) | assert the panel still reads `+9/+10/+11` and `CAP_PANEL` bit 1; a drift here is a silent capability loss, so make it a build-time `ASSERT` |
| **P6** | text metrics and host staging (P2 of §5) | read `SCREEN_WIDTH`/`STRLEN` from the pinned tree and compute the usable row count; if it is below what the panel draws, the fallback strings move |
| **P7** | timing (E14) | measure one host round trip in frames on a 1× and a 4× build; if 90 frames is not enough, the timeout or the pump changes |

**Sequencing: P1 first.** It is the only one that cannot be decided by reading, and P2/P4 are cheap
only once its answer is known. **Do not port the panel to Polished before P1 is measured** — the
whole feature is a graphics lease, and the lease's reveal step is exactly what is unresolved.

## Coordinator correction (2026-10-04) - section 2.2 is WRONG

`home/menu.asm` `AutomaticGetMenuBottomCoord` does `ld a,[wMenuDataItems] / add a / inc a`: the
bottom edge is `top + 2*items + 1` (each item takes two rows), NOT `top + items + 1`. The OMP read
`add a` as a no-op. Consequences:

* Start menu at `menu_coords 10, 0, 19, 17`: the rows run 0..17, so the box holds at most **8 items**
  (`0 + 2*8 + 1 = 17`). `SetUpMenuItems` can already produce 8 (Pokedex, Pokemon, Pack, Pokegear,
  Status, Save, Option, Exit; Quit replaces Save only in a bug contest).
* A 9th (or the "tenth") SLink item gives bottom 19 and **does not fit**; the box overflows the
  18-row screen. The "no box edit and no scrollbar change" conclusion is retracted.
* The panel therefore needs an item **swap** (take over a dead or conditional id, as on Radical Red
  and vanilla Crystal), or a box/scroll change that is NOT yet designed. The table has 9 rows but only
  8 are ever live at once (Quit and Save are exclusive), so taking over the `STARTMENUITEM_QUIT`
  slot is an option only when it is not a bug contest; that conflict is UNRESOLVED.
* The `AutomaticGetMenuBottomCoord` CLAIMS row still verifies (the quote exists); only the
  conclusion drawn from it is wrong.

## Stage 2 implementation (2026-10-04, append-only) — the panel is a NATIVE TEXT BOX, not a graphics lease

This section is the delivered answer to the card above, and it retires §5's "central open question"
by **not asking it**. Built and published on the overlay
`9c60bc8fb26ac13c52705b8086f8a5fb91d7bd93` (UPS 393 B); UPR patch-0020's `$0070` bridge and `$0DA8`
lead-in spans are unchanged in extent, ABI stays 3, and `caps` is now `SLINK_CAP_PANEL`.

### The blocker is avoided, not solved

E7 (*"`call WaitBGMap2` … UNVERIFIED"*) and P1 (*"settle the reveal primitive"*) describe a graphics
lease: the host paints `wTileMap`/`wAttrmap` while hidden and the cartridge reveals with a transfer
primitive Polished does not have. **Stage 2 never takes that lease.** The host publishes the page as
**text in the game's own charmap** and the ROM hands it to `PrintText`, whose
`SetUpTextbox -> ClearSpeechBox -> ApplyTilemap` chain (`home/text.asm:136-163`) owns the tilemap.

Consequences, all of them the point:

| E7-era concern | Stage 2 |
|---|---|
| `WaitBGMap2` replacement | **none needed** — no host-written tilemap is ever transferred |
| `wAttrmap` at `00:c308` | **not touched** — no attribute map is written at all |
| `GetSGBLayout` replacement | **not needed** — `PrintText`/`SpeechTextbox` set up the text palette |
| new graphics tiles | **none** — the page is the game's own proportional font |
| the 90-frame stage timeout | **kept** (`.WaitForStage`, `panel.asm:83`) — a late host must not retype a page the player has already read |

The page is therefore *visually* native: the game's own textbox border, palettes, blinking `▼`
prompt and per-frame print. P1 is left un-run rather than answered; it is moot for this design.

### The wire: 2 lines of 16 glyphs inside the 69-byte mailbox

`patch/polished/src/slink_mailbox.asm` keeps Polished's `SECTION "Unused", WRAM0` at **exactly 69
bytes** — no clean symbol moves, and `verify_symbol_scope` still passes — and repartitions it:

```
wSlinkMailbox::  ds 34   ; ABI core +0..13, trade lease +14..29, private sample +30/+31, phone +32/+33
wSlinkPanelText:: ds 35  ; the staged page
wSlinkMailboxEnd::
```

`SLINK_PANEL_LINES 2` x `SLINK_PANEL_LINE_MAX 16` + one terminator = a 17-byte stride, so a page is
**two lines of sixteen glyphs** and `34 + 2*17 = 68 <= 69`. `lua/gb_panel.lua` pages by
`rows_per_page`, so a five-row payload is three pages.

**This is a capacity limit, not a taste call.** The mailbox cannot grow: `verify_symbol_scope`
(`tools/build_gen2_companion.py:661`) raises on *any* moved clean symbol, and every claimable WRAM0
`ds` region outside this section is inside a `SECTION UNION`. A full 4x16 page needs `4*17 = 68`
bytes of page space (a 107-byte span) and therefore a gate change of its own.

### Current ROM rendering and input wait

Correction 2026-10-06: this section used to be titled "Why the ROM script needs nothing new" and described
a `SlinkPanelScript` (`<RAM>` / `<LNBRK>` / `<RAM>` text-command chain). That symbol no longer exists. The
chain resumed line 2 at the end of line 1's cursor and wrapped past the box edge (a live finding, recorded
in the `panel.asm` comment at lines 55-58 and in `LIVE_PANEL.md`). The current source
(`patch/polished/src/panel.asm`):

* `SlinkPanelFallback` (line 149) prints `SOUL LINK` / `NO CLIENT` and ends in `done` (line 152), not
  `prompt`, so `AWAIT` is published (line 49) before the panel waits on anything.
* On the staged path (line 53 `cp SLINK_PANEL_STAGED`), the ROM forces an `@` terminator on both mailbox
  rows (lines 65-67) and paints them with two separate `rst PlaceString` calls, at
  `(TEXTBOX_INNERX, TEXTBOX_INNERY)` and `TEXTBOX_INNERY + 1` (lines 68-73).
* Both the staged path (`jr .waitkey`, line 79) and the timeout path (`.nostage`, line 80) reach
  `.WaitForButton` (call at line 88, routine at line 132). It consumes the opening key (the `A` that chose
  "Call" is still held) and waits for a fresh edge.
* There is no `SlinkPanelScript` and no chained `<RAM>` / `<LNBRK>` renderer.
  `tests/unit/test_polished_panel.py` asserts the symbol's absence (line 157).

The charmap-safety check below still applies to the bytes the host stages.

**Charmap safety (checked, not assumed):** `PlaceNextChar` (`home/text.asm:184-194`) treats bytes
below `$5f` as commands/n-grams and the n-gram block is `$0a-$51`, which *overlaps printable ASCII* —
a raw-ASCII copy would render `" "` (`$20`) as the n-gram `"ha"`. Polished's charmap puts literals at
`$7f`+ (`" "` = 127, `"A"` = 128), above `BATTLEEXTRA_GFX_START = $5f`, so every staged byte is a
glyph. The one control code the host writes is the terminator `$53` (`@`), and it comes from the
generated pack (`overlay.panel.terminator`), not a literal.

### Placement

`SlinkPanel` lives in bank `$7E` after the service, and the ROM0 phone gate bank-switches to it and
back (`slink.asm:181-185`). `PrintText` (`00:0e58`), `DelayFrame` (`00:0da8`) and `JoyTextDelay`
(`00:07c3`) are all ROM0, so a `$7E` body calls them with a plain `call`. ROM0 `$3F34-$3FFF` had only
~204 bytes and the phone bridge already uses 83.

`SlinkPhone_CallGate` now **drops the Stage-1 stub text** (`"SLink is linked."`) and enters the panel.
`wPokegearPhoneCursorPosition` (`00:C51D`) and `wPokegearPhoneScrollPosition` (`00:C51E`) are never
touched; the list is redrawn by the native `PokegearText_WhomToCall`, so B closes with the cursor
exactly where the player left it.

### UNVERIFIED (Stage 2)

1. **No live run yet.** Nothing here has been driven on a cartridge: whether `PrintText` renders a
   host-staged WRAM page, whether the prompt's `ButtonSound` loop lets the sampled counter move
   enough for the client to call the mailbox live (`P.STALL = 60`), and whether two lines *reads* as
   vanilla are all open. This is the single most important gap.
2. **Patch-0020 signature bytes not diffed** against the Stage-1 ROM `34942315…`. Span extents are
   unchanged; bytes are unverified.
3. **Server row width.** `Gen2GSCAdapter.info_panel_width()` returns `0`
   (`server/adapters/gen2_gsc.py:654`), so `_build_link_panel` (`server/server.py:1886`) takes the
   *wide* branch and emits `label|field|…` rows rather than the compact single-line rows a sixteen
   column textbox wants. An adapter card, not this one.
