# Gen 2 coverage map — concrete planned bindings

This P2 binding maps **102 of 102 obligations**: 53 requirements and 49 protocol section 9 assertions, including 38a/38b. There are **zero UNMAPPED** rows. All six future overlay/ghost target slots remain explicitly PLANNED and unhashed. Every evidence cell remains OPEN. Mapping a scenario does not claim that its implementation exists, its lane ran, its artifact is admitted, or its behavior passed.

Bindings are authored by the team from PLAN, GEN2_BINDING_PLAN section 5 and its row joins, the requirements, protocol section 9, inspected P2 tools/tests and the runner manifest. Routine mapping is not an owner hand-entry prerequisite.

## Binding interpretation

* The marked JSON block is authoritative. Each MAPPED row specifies stimulus, artifact scope, positive/refusal controls, independent oracle, lane and receipt marker.
* PLANNED BINDING is an executable-scenario specification, not an execution result. EXISTS identifies inspected source/model tools; PLANNED filenames remain phase targets without a claim of present implementation. Native flows and fixtures are unqualified.
* SOURCE-only: F-1/F-4/F-5/F-7g. MODEL-only by design: C-0/C-4/D-13. Their declared layers are unchanged. All 49 protocol assertions retain the explicit SOURCE+PHYSICAL caller policy; production-graph fake-server observations remain supplementary MODEL.
* NATURAL engine scenarios and COMMAND executor scenarios remain separate. SOURCE and MODEL stimuli do not qualify physical behavior. C-6g/D-1 explicitly include C-G link alongside C-C/G-S representatives.
* Plain clean digests are selected source candidates, not runtime admission. Crystal1.1 remains build-only. P4/P5 targets use separate descriptors; their unknown digests are null, never substituted with base-ROM hashes.
* Artifact scope is independently injected through the runner's explicit target declarations and obligation bindings. Removing or changing a target inside this map cannot grant evidence eligibility. CLOSED evidence on a PLANNED target refuses in every mode/layer.
* P4 reopens affected source/site/checkpoint/admission/natural-rule receipts on the actual overlay. Reuse requires byte/offset AND reachability-context equivalence. Complete runtime/client/profile/fixture fingerprints remain phase evidence prerequisites.

## Conditional and phase applicability

W-3/W-4/C-5/D-11 remain default-disabled/deferred without an enabling ruling. Their planned bindings specify refusal/disposition controls and enabled-branch prerequisites. N-3 remains post-RC under O-13, after G6 and authorized design. OPEN cells do not fabricate signed applicability records or behavior passes.

The raw inventory's 95 declared PHYSICAL cells span all phases plus conservative protocol policy; they are not a first-release required count. GEN2_BINDING_PLAN section 5.B identifies 41 first-G6 requirement-level physical obligations with the four conditionals disabled and N-3 post-RC. D-12 needs its own GAME transient receipt or signed recorded limit. The future P6 release-evidence binder must evaluate those signed applicability/disposition records; raw all-phase closure mode does not replace it.

## Current inputs and artifact policy

The coordinator integrated docs/gen2/gen2_requirements.md byte-for-byte from the reviewed planning tree. Requirements, protocol and source lock are now all present in this implementation tree. Their raw hashes were not changed by this task.

| Input | SHA256 |
|---|---|
| requirements | 7be51a425d1120763832f3220d0584e1e5655795c1f79fc4c4f224b63fd0f9df |
| protocol | e18964d5628f826ae8c6352b728eea2c6d2f10d8e83a2e81fc4a559c2823462e |
| artifact_policy | 113b41354f65a9859bf878cedb334de27e0c9e3ff0f2cc13693889dfd524a3ed |

| Current clean source candidate | SHA1 |
|---|---|
| pokecrystal | f4cd194bdee0d04ca4eac29e09b8e4e9d818c133 |
| pokegold | d8b8a3600a465308c9953dfa04f0081c05bdcb94 |
| pokesilver | 49b163f7e57702bc939d642a18f591de55d92dae |

| Planned target | Known lineage anchor | State | Target digest |
|---|---|---|---|
| crystal_overlay | pokecrystal | PLANNED | null |
| crystal_ghost | pokecrystal | PLANNED | null |
| gold_overlay | pokegold | PLANNED | null |
| gold_ghost | pokegold | PLANNED | null |
| silver_overlay | pokesilver | PLANNED | null |
| silver_ghost | pokesilver | PLANNED | null |

The base anchors an already built source lineage, not an assertion of the target's complete eventual build manifest or immediate patch parent. Actual overlay/ghost builds later supply BUILT descriptors, real target digests, full provenance and new matching receipts. Current planned-target receipts can never transfer to that new mapping.

## F-3 — per-family differential witness design

The owner contract remains **ENGINE + PYDEC/GAME (method: differential gate across titles)**. Every family below requires ENGINE occurrence at its qualified CPU site. PYDEC is selected for independently measurable party/box/identity/bag/save byte effects; GAME is selected where native engine, UI or control state is the observation. These are concrete test-design choices within the existing slash policy, not a new universal ENGINE+PYDEC+GAME requirement, a normative rewrite, or an exemption. All scenarios and receipts remain PLANNED/OPEN.

Common ENGINE control: record title, artifact, routine/site, bank, PC/caller, frame and load-verified expected bytes; reject a missing family/title, wrong-bank/caller event, or script-bytecode substitute. The family-specific positive/refusal controls and independent observations are below. Source-site presence and a callback alone do not satisfy the independent witness.

Phase/lane: P2.2/P3b.4 / live-new-gates. Planned implementation: tests/live/test_gen2_new_gates.py signal-family rows, consuming independent gen2_codec bytes or native GAME observations. Aggregate receipt marker: gen2.requirement.F-3; family submarkers append the stable family name. The actual physical gate must account for every family on every selected title.

| Family | Positive stimulus/control | Refusal control | Selected independent witness |
|---|---|---|---|
| battle_start_wild | Walk into a source-supported wild encounter on each selected title. Wild battle entry occurs once with the actual species and battle UI visible. | A trainer encounter or ordinary overworld step must not satisfy the wild-start subclaim. | GAME: Native wild-battle screen/state, compared with the routine's independently captured ENGINE occurrence. |
| battle_start_trainer | Accept a known trainer challenge on each selected title. Trainer battle entry occurs once with the native trainer identity/display. | A wild battle or canceled/unreached challenge must not satisfy trainer-start. | GAME: Native trainer introduction and battle state; no PYDEC party-mutation witness is required for this control-state family. |
| battle_end_result | Naturally win, flee and take the permitted losing/recovery route from completed battles. The battle-end occurrence agrees with the observed exit/outcome transition. | An in-battle turn or unrelated transient result-bit value must not be accepted as battle completion. | GAME: Native battle exit/result/recovery state; transient wBattleResult bits alone are not the oracle. |
| capture_party | Catch a wild mon with a free party slot through the native capture path. The routine occurrence accompanies one newly decoded final party record and count/slot change. | A failed throw or full-party box destination must not satisfy party-capture. | PYDEC: Independent same-frame party/count/name bytes before and after insertion; identity comes from the final acquired record. |
| capture_box | With party full, catch into a non-final box slot and into slot20. Each successful SendMonIntoBox occurrence accompanies the independently decoded inserted box record. | A failed throw, full-box refusal or party-space catch must not satisfy box-insertion; box-full flag alone is insufficient. | PYDEC: Independent active-box count, inserted record/name and relevant backing bytes with frame/domain recorded. |
| player_faint | Naturally faint the active player mon by a battle action. The player-faint occurrence corresponds to the same identified party record changing from HP>0 to0. | Opponent faint, an already-zero record or client-command HP zeroing must not satisfy natural player-faint. | PYDEC: Independent pre/post party HP and full record identity captured before any healing. |
| poison_faint | Walk with an eligible poisoned party mon until native overworld poison reduces its HP to0. DoPoisonStep's faint occurrence corresponds to that exact record's HP transition. | A nonterminal poison tick, a healthy mon or an already-zero record must not satisfy poison-faint. | PYDEC: Independent step-aligned party HP/status/identity bytes; no inferred death from a later healed snapshot. |
| whiteout | Naturally lose the last previously alive party mon and observe the native whiteout/recovery flow. The qualified CPU entry occurs before HealParty and corresponds to the game's whiteout/recovery state. | A surviving party member, loaded all-zero party or unrelated healing/menu path must not satisfy whiteout. | GAME: Native whiteout/recovery transition, with ENGINE establishing the required pre-HealParty occurrence; record-level faint claims remain the separate faint families. |
| evolution_publish | Finish an eligible natural evolution, and separately cancel one before publication. Completed evolution occurrence corresponds to the same mon's final species/key change. | Canceled evolution or pre-publication animation must leave the prior identity and cannot satisfy publication. | PYDEC: Independent old/final party species and identity bytes from the actual publication slot. |
| npc_trade | Complete a native NPC trade with distinguishable offered/received records. Final trade occurrence corresponds to the received record in its post-compaction/final slot. | Decline or fail prerequisites; a pre-compaction slot or a same-species substitute cannot satisfy the record observation. | PYDEC: Independent before/after party records, OT/name/identity and final slot layout. |
| link_trade | Complete the phase-qualified native link-trade path with distinguishable records on both sides. The link-trade engine occurrence agrees with the actually received record on each cartridge. | Decline/interruption before commit or a wrong received identity must not satisfy successful link-trade. | PYDEC: Independent final party identities on both sides; save durability is evaluated by save/reload families and T-4 rather than inferred from the routine return. |
| pc_deposit | Use the native PC to deposit an eligible party mon. Deposit occurrence corresponds to its removal from party and insertion into the active box. | Cancel the menu or only view a box; neither may satisfy deposit. | PYDEC: Independent party/box counts and exact moved record/name before and after the operation. |
| pc_withdraw | Use the native PC to withdraw an eligible boxed mon. Withdrawal occurrence corresponds to that record leaving the box and entering party. | Cancel or attempt withdrawal with full party; neither may satisfy successful movement. | PYDEC: Independent active-box and party records/counts, including compaction and destination slot. |
| pc_release | Confirm release of an eligible boxed mon using the native PC. Release occurrence corresponds to removal of that exact record and expected surviving-slot compaction. | Cancel the confirmation or inspect another record; unchanged storage cannot satisfy release. | PYDEC: Independent box record/name inventory before and after confirmed release; protocol handling of linked release is a separate S-6 obligation. |
| pc_changebox | Select another box through the native ChangeBox flow and return to PC. The ChangeBox occurrence agrees with the active box identified by the game's own header/selection. | Cancel ChangeBox or revisit the same view without a change; neither satisfies a new box-selection transition. | GAME: Native PC active-box header/selection state; storage persistence is separately checked where promised. |
| map_load | Walk/warp through a known source-defined map boundary on each title. Map-load occurrence corresponds to the game's new map/scene presentation. | A same-map step or unrelated fade/menu must not satisfy a new map load. | GAME: Native map/scene transition and known destination presentation, compared across title-specific source map facts. |
| ball_received | Receive Poké Balls through the native grant or purchase path with Ball-pocket capacity. The bag-received occurrence agrees with the independently decoded Ball-pocket item/count delta. | No-capacity/declined grant or a non-ball item change must not satisfy ball-received. | PYDEC: Independent Ball-pocket bytes/counts; O-10 fixture injection is not a natural ball-acquisition witness. |
| save_success | Complete an in-game SAVE and separately cancel/refuse overwrite. The success-only save occurrence agrees with the resulting independently decoded CartRAM save record/checksum layout. | Save-entry-only occurrence, canceled overwrite or unchanged stale witness must not satisfy successful save. | PYDEC: Independent success-boundary CartRAM bytes and per-title save/checksum decoding; full cold-reload GAME qualification remains F-6/T-4 where declared. |
| continue | Cold-boot a qualified existing save and choose CONTINUE. The load occurrence agrees with native CONTINUE reaching that saved game state. | Title idle, canceled selection or rejected/both-bad save recovery must not satisfy successful CONTINUE. | GAME: Native load/CONTINUE outcome; distinguish this path from New Game without treating an entry call as load success. |
| new_game | Choose New Game through its native confirmation/naming/start flow. The new-game occurrence agrees with the game's fresh initialization flow. | Decline overwrite or choose CONTINUE; the retained prior run cannot satisfy New Game. | GAME: Native new-game confirmation/start/control state, including the difference from the loaded-save path. |
| soft_reset | Perform the supported native soft-reset input and observe return to reset/title flow. The reset occurrence agrees with the game's reset/title transition. | Ordinary title/menu visits or unrelated input must not satisfy a reset; stale in-flight lifecycle state is a separate R-4/C-2 refusal. | GAME: Native reset/title control-state observation with independent frame/ENGINE occurrence. |
| egg_hatch | Naturally hatch an existing egg through the game's hatch sequence. Hatch publication occurrence agrees with the independently decoded hatchling record/key. | GiveEgg alone or pre-hatch steps must not satisfy hatch publication. | PYDEC: Independent egg marker to final species/identity transition at the actual party slot; gift_daycare consumption is separately observed by S-8/D-1. |

Saved-record durability remains scoped to the requirements that promise it (for example F-6 and T-4); a LinkTrade return or ENGINE occurrence is never promoted into a reload witness. O-10 fixture Ball-pocket injection does not qualify the natural ball-received family. Native link/PC/acquisition flows and all fixtures remain unqualified until their lanes run.

The JSON F-3 mapping repeats the family stimuli, controls and method selections, so its mapping digest binds these choices; the table is an index, not an unbound substitute for machine-readable policy.

## Checks and explicit planned-target bindings

Schema and eligibility rules are in [shared-coverage-map.md](../shared-coverage-map.md). The registered runner now supplies these explicit flags; targets are never inferred from this map's own claims.

Inventory and mapping modes validate the complete planned map. Closure mode still refuses the six unbuilt target slots and all OPEN evidence. A mapping pass establishes neither native behavior nor owner gate acceptance.
