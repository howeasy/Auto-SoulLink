# Gen 3 migration — resume note (2026-09-21, session 2 in progress)

Read this first after compaction. Authority: the owner-approved plan `docs/gen3/PLAN.md` (rev 5, §6 phases, §14 dispatch, §14.1 gate ledger) and the sole work ledger, the `AGENT_CHECKPOINT` block in the sweep worktree's `docs/gen1_reference/RC_MASTER_GUIDE.md` (`E:/Google Drive/SLink/.claude/worktrees/gen1-rby-code-sweep-8d06e2`). Requirements ledger: `docs/gen3_requirements.md`.

## Where things are

- Worktree `E:/Google Drive/SLink/.claude/worktrees/gen3-migration-planning-5d8e45`, branch `claude/gen3-migration-planning-5d8e45`, pushed to origin on owner authority (2026-09-21) so CI could build the pret symbols. Not merged to master. Base: master `4749a2c`.
- Coordinator: Claude session `92be0738-12a4-4228-b388-eb5fe6f7c779` (Fable 5.1). Codex live thread "Plan Gen3 support" (repo root, `E:/Google Drive/SLink`) is the research/implementation peer; headless Codex persists `gen3-syms`, `gen3-tap` exist (their sandbox cannot run Python: the coordinator runs their checks).
- Owner rulings (G0 signed 2026-09-21): FRLG vanilla + Radical Red only; strangler; battery fixtures; agbcc git pin; admitted companion = what the shipped `SLink-RR.ups` produces (md5 `bf8e94a0…`, patcher pin corrected at `72dffad`); LeafGreen dump placed and verified; keep the two-reviewer G6 precedent; `codex/rr-foundation` tagged `archive/codex/rr-foundation` (local); vanilla FRLG trade NOT in this release; no `sync_pending`/`trade_failed`.

## Gate status

| Gate | Status |
|---|---|
| G0 | SIGNED (PLAN §14.1) |
| G1 | **evidence complete, not yet requested**: hook probe PASS on FR clean + RR companion (`docs/gen3/probes/hooks_*_2026-09-21.txt`), frame-end census (`census_rr_overworld_2026-09-21.txt`: R15 parked in BIOS `0x1C4`, System/ARM), flash domain = `SRAM` 0x20000, six RR duos PASS twice on the old client, golden transcripts committed (`tests/fixtures/gen3/wire/`, 796K, four gzipped), conformance suite 16 passed with the old-client characterization (items 1/14 documented as A19; 29/30 were checker over-assertions; 28 unevidenced). Ask the owner to sign G1 with those receipts. |
| G2 | **evidence complete, report committed** (`docs/gen3/G2_report_2026-09-21.md`, 7e81a42): all P2 packs landed; RR boot-check PASS (aaf079d), FR fixture made + boot-checked (eedb93c), RR `_b` derived + boot-checked (c2a2f5d), Haiku spot-check PASS, quick runner 4/4 (478 unit). Ask the owner to sign G2 as pinned facts only once the report is committed. |

## Landed this session (planning branch, in order)

## Session 2 (2026-09-21, after compaction)

- Relayed task from the pureRGB session (Codex cx-0921a375): old Gen 3 client sound cues were last-write-wins. Landed `f55c4d1`: `lua/sfx_arbiter.lua` + client `M.sfx` (GAME_OVER > whiteout > linked KO > generic, one flush per frame in `on_frame_safe`, deferred KO muted after game_over), 15 lupa tests, shipped by make_release. Old client is byte-identical to master 2629d36 → cherry-pick candidate for the owner. Codex REVIEW cx-e8acc8bc REJECTED round 1 (a client cue newly routed native could be queued behind a same-frame native memorialize and overwrite its ack on pump-before-poll); fixed in 16c1553/6428a46/a76103a (winner carries a native_ok flag; only the server play_sound site sets it; tie keeps native only if all allowed); round 2 cx-c26a5baa REJECTED too (a deferred server sound queued behind a native op inverts the pre-arbiter order); fixed at 4aab46d exactly as recommended: `MB.busy()` in lua/mailbox.lua, native sound only while the mailbox has no outstanding work, regression test over the real mailbox.lua with a memory stub + negative control (72 tests); round 3 cx-3c3b6319 ACCEPT (comment narrowed at ac518de). Card closed; cherry-pick f55c4d1..ac518de onto master is the owner's call. Pre-existing pump-before-poll ack weakness (server play_sound beside native memorialize) queued for P5 native.lua. Not verified: in-emulator native route (RR audio trace, lane item).
- Instrument findings: BizHawk names the battery with spaces for unknown ROMs (`gen3 slink RR.SaveRAM`, now the default) and by gamedb name for known ones (`Pokemon - FireRed Version (USA).SaveRAM`, needs `--saveram-name`); the flash counter appears ~950 frames before the 14-sector loop ends (~66 frames/sector), so `gen3_boot_check.lua` waits for 14/14 sectors (flushing at the counter yields a torn slot).
- FR new-game script: walk-out PINNED from pret/pokefirered c75f352 (cloned to `E:/Google Drive/SLink/.cache/pret/pokefirered`): spawn (6,6) 2F, stairs (10,2) via Left arrow-warp, 1F door (4,8) via Down, town map 768; steps verified by SaveBlock1 coords; stalled steps clear textboxes with A (RR intro dialogue). Intro legs remain timed, verified by outcome. `firered_town.sav` is PRE-STARTER (empty party): scenarios needing a party need an extended script through the starter choice (queued).

## In flight / uncommitted at compaction

- Nothing. C2-3c landed (09add4e: RR 19 kinds PINNED per artifact; GiveMonToPlayer/SendMonToPC detours followed to their CFRU bodies; SetPlacedMonData edited in place; overworld poison is a verified no-op body on RR so its two rows are un-emitted by design; borrowed_party/nature_change UNVERIFIED with search receipts). `python tools/verify_gen3_release.py --quick`: all four fast lanes PASS (the unit lane now selects by file, never `-k`, because the fail-closed core counts deselection as not-run).

## Next actions (in order)

1. Owner signs **G1** (receipts in the gate table). Record in PLAN §14.1.
2. Owner signs **G2** as pinned facts only (report `docs/gen3/G2_report_2026-09-21.md`). Record in PLAN §14.1.
3. Owner decides the cherry-pick of f55c4d1..ac518de onto master (old client identical there).
4. P3 (shadow observer) opens after G2 per PLAN §6/§14: cards C3-1..C3-5 + P3a.
5. Queued out-of-lease: mailbox pump-before-poll ack lifetime (P5 native.lua); extended FR script through the starter (party for faint/boxsync); RR audio/frame trace of the native SE route; `server/adapters/gen3_codec.py:391-394` stale CFRU comment; RR overworld-poison `poison_faint` N/A in the coverage table; `tools/mkstates.py:102` RTC wording; fold `ROM_SPECS` duplicates; `data/gen3/pret/README.md`; `flash_save.md` §7 superseded rows; RR profile `GMAIN_ADDR`; "box the last mon" capture for item 28; retire census probe UNVERIFIED notes; borrowed_party/nature_change UNVERIFIED.

## Standing rules that bit this session

Codex headless sandboxes cannot launch Python: always run their checks yourself. The Bash tool breaks on heredocs with odd apostrophe counts: use the Edit/Write tools for code. Shared `server/` changes need `slink-adapter-guard` + a non-author review; the guard blocked once (unguarded tap I/O) and passed after the fix. The fail-closed runner counts a collection-time skip from an unrelated module as a failure: keep lane selectors tight.
